I even enjoyed seeing the minor characters through the movie, so much that I cared about their outcomes. Not to mention that they are believable. The main character in this film isn't some invulnerable super action hero, he is frail and inexperienced when it comes to fighting.

Every once in a while during the viewing of this film I felt as if I hadn't really accomplished anything in life. Hughes lived such a fascinating life compared to that of an average Joe. It is really kind of sad that his phobias got the best of him and he spend the final two decades of his life in isolation. Who knows what he could have accomplished.As for the performances, they were all amazing. I have never really been a fan of Leo, but I was really impressed with his performance. It was amazing.

A lot of things, such as lightsabers and mind tricks, are not explained and may confuse people. Second is acting.

Some people compare it to The Shining. There is even the obligatory overhead shot referring to this movie. But they are worlds apart. This is so lazy and unimaginative in its execution that it is hardly lifted above the average. The house offered many possibilities to explore as a character (with its ghosts) but all the shots in and around the house are without any imagination. As Chelsea enters the roof there are few shots suggesting depth. As the ghosts are shown, they have almost no dramatic impact on the viewer. The transformation of George the father is not very insightful portrayed for the viewer: He turns from father to maniac in an instant and that's not very plausible. A plot twist could have helped the movie regain some interest half-way (e.g. George non-existent but only imagined, George a reincarnation of the original killer). But we are served a simple explanation (why has there to be one at all and why that simple?).Horror movies go through a difficult period. There is an audience out there, but we need more creativity from the people who make them.

Of course you must ignore the fact Reggie tossed that shotgun in the first one and now he has it and Jody is played by a different guy, other than that I can roll with it. A bit to much humor is used in this one too, as this also takes away from the movie's spookiness as well. Still the scene with the robbers going into the house and being hunted down by the kid is pretty cool and there are other scenes that make this movie enjoyable and not boring.

While, all this is happening a psychopath (Stephen Rae) is kidnapping girls and torturing them live on the net. So, is there any connection between the two activities?

It just becomes tiresome and rather dull story telling, with uninspired performances from the leads that aren't capable of carrying a film and are hardly convincing in their roles. The plot doesn't make too much sense, with pointless subplots and no real cohesion. It does get very muddled with its ridiculous outcomes and it focusing on sequences that are full of tedium. When it reaches the pointless ending you'll think why did I bother? Not much of a mystery is achieved as no tension, atmosphere and detail is built. It basically rips off the plot of \"Ringu/The Ring\". Instead of a video it's now a haunted Website. You can also throw in ideas from \"Videodrome\" (the better of the three) into the mix. The script is fairly mortifying, with such trite dialogue coming out of the their mouths. The screenplay is plain unexciting and ineffective. Performances from the likes of Stephen Dorff, Natascha McElhone and Stephen Rae were by the numbers. They were just so uninteresting and unbelievable that you just didn't care for them. Look out for a small cameo from Jeffery Combs (Re-animator and From Beyond). What the film went for was slick visuals, potent camera-work and flashy editing. Visually it was good, though towards the end the whole treatment did kind of get annoying and incredibly repetitious. The look of the film was incredibly dark, with many gloomy sequences involving dimly lit corridors and rooms. Even the sombre mood or fine score couldn't help it raise any chills.

It is a live performance, with all the drawbacks that that entails - some singers are less audible from certain positions on-stage, but there is a lot of movement, so such a problem tends to be short-lived. The moving about can occasionally get noisy, too - characters stepping on and off the raised stage almost always make a loud thump, perhaps because microphones were located near the front - I seldom noticed it if people were walking around in the background. The sets are a bit goofy, but bright-colored and amusing; the chairs look particularly uncomfortable.For the most part the singing is quite good - Raimondi, who is by far the best actor, has a nice strong voice as Selim, and can sing as fast as anyone. The duet between Selim and Don Geronio in Act II, which culminates in a blistering patter song as the two threaten to murder each other, is the highlight of the opera. Paolo Rumetz is good as Don Geronio, though I think that maybe the role was originally intended for an older man - I get the impression that Geronio and Fiorilla are supposed to be a ridiculous May/December mismatch, with a feeble old man unable to control his young, lively wife. Still, this Geronio may not be old, but he does come across as a perpetually fogged simpleton, yet kind-hearted enough not to lose the audience's sympathy. Cecilia Bartoli is a fine singer, but her Fiorilla seems so much tougher than Geronio that it's hard not to feel sorry for him. I think she might be trying too hard to be brilliant and fascinating - her singing part is a difficult one, so she's got a lot to handle, but her facial contortions can be a bit off-putting. She might have done better just to relax and sing instead of trying to act so much. Reinaldo Macias is not the strongest tenor I've heard, but he's not a bad actor, and he bears an astonishing resemblance to a young Jean-François Balmer. It's quite delightful to see him simply lapse into bliss every time he catches sight of his own reflection in the polished knob of his fancy walking stick.

Funny, though, I rented this because Saeed Jaffrey was in it playing \"Billy Fish.\" I enjoyed watching Saeed in the Merchant-Ivory pictures and in the British thriller \"Killing Kind,\" and in the new pyx w/ Burt Reynolds set in Amsterdam called \"Snapshots.\" These guys have such appealing chutzpah together and twinkle along with preposterous schemes and grandiose impulses, and they have a kind of honor about friendship and loyalty. Guided by a lot of luck, they do manage to take over leadership of a small, devout country that accepts the Masonic emblem as proof of Connery's Divinity! What a comedic romp this becomes. And Sean, at first Solomon-like in his wisdom,soon becomes tarnished and, with veiled lasciviousness, decides to wed. That sets off the old Dudes who were the Guiding Gurus before Connery got there. Michael Caine should not have stuck around for the wedding. Caine was ready to split because he couldn't stomach the direction Connery was going in, with the Kingship Routine and the hedonism. But Caine DID stick around and when the wedding day dawned, and when the bride BIT Connery and he BLED, well, the Old Dude Gurus gave the go-ahead for the mob of citizenry to give Connery 'what fer.' And they managed to do this. Caine lived thru it all to come back and regale Kipling (what a terrific, never-before-seen job of underplaying a role Chrisopher Plummer did here - he was simply magnificent and I did not recognize the actor in any way/shape/form as accustomed to him by his later roles)with the entire story. This is an original tale. The photography was luscious. It makes you appreciate John Huston's work all the more. Some movie people you just don't wanna see age. And that applies to Caine, Connery, Huston, Plummer, and certainly not the fine Saheed Jaffrey, whose cultured speaking intonations are thrilling to hear and who has aged to perfection, now around 76. I hope the movie-makers will utilize this gentleman in good roles of grace and meaning until he is too old to memorize dialogue! This is a great film for younger people to go back and see.

They tried to tell a balanced view of the tale, by including viewpoints of both white settlers and of the dispossessed Indians. It was a noble effort, and very brave.Sadly, they created an inconsistent, oftentimes disappointing, product.The plot line revolving around the Lakota people was brilliant. The tale of young medicine man Loved by the Buffalo is wonderfully done and completely heart-wrenching. There is a high level of authenticity, plausibility, and interest around these Indians and their families. The saga of the Lakota is the shining spot on this miniseries. I didn't find too much fault with any of the Indian segments of this miniseries, they did justice to Black Kettle and Little Bighorn and the Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee, forming a cohesive and emotional story of the various tribes of natives.It's the stories surrounding the white settlers that are horrible.The primary problem is the obvious desire of the filmmakers to include every major event and icon in Western history into five two-hour episodes. They include Jebediah Smith's quest for the California coast. They include Bleeding Kansas. They include wagon trains. They include blasting railroad tunnels. They include the Golden Spike ceremony. They include the Gold Rush. The include the Pony Express. They include practically every event you could think of into these episodes. This required huge contrivances on the part of the writers. They created a huge family from western Virginia, made them all hungry for adventure, and scattered them throughout every major event whether their presence made sense or not. The main character, Jacob Wheeler (horribly played by Matthew Settle in the beginning, better played as \"old Jacob\" by John Terry), manages to not only make it to California but also marries a Lakota woman, has some kids, abandons his family, becomes a mountain man, joins the army and defeats the Mexicans, pans for gold, rejoins his family, has some more kids, and manages to live an unnatural long life ... very little of which is believable.The secondary problem is the writing. So much of the dialogue is contrived and overdone. Because the producers wanted to include every event, all the actors were forced to read long speeches describing what was going on at that time. Plus they embellished it with so many period colloquialisms it would choke an English major. Made the dialogue more distracting than interesting. This was double jeopardy in the first three episodes where Matthew Settle not only delivers bad dialogue on-screen, but also has to read some of the hokeyness via narration (quite possibly the worst use of narration in any film).There's plenty of lousy acting to be had. The worst by far is the aforementioned Matthew Settle, but there are so many I couldn't possibly count all the bad performances. Again, with dialogue and choices as bad as those mentioned earlier, not too many actors could have pulled it off.Towards the end there is some redemption for this series. The fourth episode, focusing on the Black Kettle massacre, the battle of Little Bighorn, and a moving piece on the forced \"assimilation\" of Indian children into American society, provides some relief from the vapidity of the prior three. And the last episode, focusing on the Ghost Dance and the Wounded Knee massacre, is actually pretty good (until Jacob Wheeler's reappearance to give the stereotypical \"high concept wrap-up\"). So it's not a total loss.But overall they could of, and should of, done a much better job on this miniseries. Thanks to some bad choices this series didn't have a chance, and it really deserved one. I am still convinced the story of the settlement of the West is a story with all the elements of great drama. But with such a bad treatment it'll be some time before anyone attempts to tell it again.5 out of 10.Barky","rw1133971","An Uneven Telling of the Story of Western Settlement","Barky44",0],[["3","5"],"Constantine (2005)","8","24 July 2005","Chances are they are die-hard fans of the Hellblazer comics/graphic novels.

They found one property, THE GRASS HARP, where they shared one scene together. But then this film was made which was fully their film together. Like most of their films Lemmon is the quiet partner who is dragged into the troublesome situation by the noisy partner Matthau. Here they are brother-in-laws (Matthau's sister, who is dead). Matthau convinces Lemmon that he needs to take a sea cruise to end his long period of mourning. Lemmon does not realize that Matthau got them free passage by signing them onto the cruise as social dancers (partners for elderly lady passengers). Lemmon can dance, but Matthau cannot, and one scene has Lemmon trying to teach Matthau, only to be caught by Donald O'Connor and Hal Linden dancing together (O'Connor and Linden jumping to the wrong conclusion). If they can't pull their weight as social dancers, they will have to pay the $1,500.00 per person fare as travelers. Neither can afford that. Matthau really could not care much about this - he hopes that he will be lucky to find, romance, and marry a wealthy woman. Lemmon is encouraged to do the same, but he is not as mercenary. As it turns out Lemmon does meet Gloria De Haven, and Matthau meets Dyan Cannon (and her mother, Elaine Stritch). But the course to true love is never smooth in movies. Matthau has a rival for Cannon, in Edward Mulhare. And Brent Spiner, the cruise entertainment director, is an evil martinet determined to impress the cruise line owner (Rue McLanahan) to put him in control of all the cruise ship's entertainment centers.It is a well-cast film, which helps (this is reminiscent of the two \"Grumpies\" films that preceded it. But those films had better balance to them. They had moments of pathos where one could see Lemmon and Matthau were not just funny men but human types. Here Lemmon is shown to have such a weakness - he has romanced De Haven in spite of his qualms, but at a critical point remembers his deep love for his first wife. But Matthau's personality is so mercenary (a \"cousin\" to his \"Whiplash Willie Gingrich\" in THE FORTUNE COOKIE), that his turning into a legitimate lover of Cannon doesn't quite sit well. Nor does it sit well when we find other likable characters can be equally mercenary.However there are plenty of great moments in the film. Spiner's unplanned involvement with a colorful local parade is one. So is Matthau's ridiculous dance with Rue McLanahan that looks atrocious (he calls his non-steps, \"the crawl\")but that she enjoys. Spiner, better known as \"Mr. Data\" the android in STAR TREK, THE NEXT GENERATION, turns in a fine comic villain performance. My only criticism is that Linden and O'Connor seem too peripheral in the plot (although both do give filler about the ruthlessness of Spiner, whom Linden really dislikes). But the film is still very amusing, and worth while seeing. Unfortunately it was not their final film.

So the jokes were often lame. So \"squeaky-clean\" wasn't everybody's thing. THAT DOES NOT MEAN EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HATES THE SHOW! As far as my family and I were concerned, \"squeaky clean\" was in. We never had to worry about the show being offensive or risqué. Choosing \"Donny & Marie\" on weekends was a no-brainer.

Cary Grant waiting on th 102 nd. floor for Deborah Kerr to appear is one such scene. This is part of the movie's charm that it has inspired generations of film-lovers. To the extent that some film-makers have actually used it as a super-plot.

I'm not just saying that because every critic has said that since the mid sixties. I'm saying that because it is a surreal mind puzzle that made me dive into my subconscious. \"Persona\" is filmed in gorgeous black and white and at an 85 minute running time it never wears out it's welcome. The montage in the beginning is sooooooooo bizarre, don't sit to close to the screen you might hallucinate. The story concerns Alma (Bibi Anderson), a nurse who is taking care of Elizabeth, played mysteriously by the sexy Liv Ullman. Elisabeth refuses to speak, she stopped talking in the middle of a play. For some reason Alma feels very comfortable around her and starts to tell her personal things. She even moves in with Elisabeth to help out. Alma explicitly talks about a sexual escapade that her and her friend experienced on the beach. The scene shows nothing sexual, but the vivid language and sexy Swedish dialog turns this moment into one of the hottest most arousing scenes in cinema history.

Alma also finds out that Elisabeth has betrayed her when she reads a letter she wrote telling a friend about her personal intimate secrets. Oh no! This is when the film turns into a crazed decent into madness as only Bergman could bring you. He even films one scene twice but at a different angle. Now if only Bergman was more optimistic; poor guy. All kidding aside, Persona is an amazing experience that breaks the fourth wall between film and reality. Images are only representational of life, Bergman shows viewers this as the camera runs out of film. This is just my interpretation. Oh heck, I think I'll have two watch this a couple more times, and not just for the explicit conversation about Alma's orgasms.

Many people have compared this portrayal of Wonka to Michael Jackson. This comparison has some merit as both seem to be trapped in their childhood, but this does not demerit the performance at all. Just because such a likeness exist does not mean the Willy Wonka should not have been played as such.Tim Burton also fleshes out the movie by adding the background of Wonka and a short segment about the history behind the Oompa Loompas. Wonka's twisted beginnings truly demonstrate why he has turned into such a clash between childhood and adulthood.Another addition of Tim Burton are the new songs for the Oompa Loompas. Instead of the stagnant tunes from \"Willy Wonka and the Chocalate Factory\", multiple short songs from various genres are played. All completely choreographed to fit with the genre, these scenes are a great laugh for those who have seen the original.*SPOILIER START* Tim Burton even injects a very funny exchange of dialogue criticizing who the dance and song by the Oompa Loompas seems setup and planned.*SPOILER END*This movie is an excellent view and I completely recommend seeing it. It provides a much fuller movie experience and covers the background and explains the future of Charlie; this is a large bonus as the original lacked any background or future. If I could I would give the movie 9.5 out of 10 because there were only a few points where the movie could have been slightly tweaked. The scene where Charly brings home the ticket just seemed to have some awkward dialogue. But by these ratings I will give it a 9, because 10 is reserved for perfection.To reiterate, this movie is a great new experience even for those who have seen the original. But if you are just looking for a new version with revamped visuals, don't waste your money. Compared to the original, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is an amazing experience, surpassing the original as an entire movie.","rw1133994","An Amazing Movie; More than a Recreation","nopurpose229",1],[["5","8"],"Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe (1990)","8","24 July 2005","For those certain people who thought it took place in space, should have read the back of the box.

This is partly because it still pokes fun at those people you should be accepting, but mostly because it has a big, big heart.I'm not a soppy person by nature, but I really loved this movie. It shone out like a gem in a sea of recent dross. I liked the fact that despite his flaws, Hal was a decent guy, and his actions in the children's hospital the final time only served to prove it.If there was one thing that did somewhat undermine its ultimate moral, it was the fact that the big gal who is the object o Hal's affections, is in fact played by stick-insect Paltrow in a fat suit. Made in America; a country where gross obesity seems to be a national pass-time, I find it impossible to believe that they couldn't find a suitable actress. Perhaps, despite the upbeat message of acceptance, the Farrely's thought that audiences couldn't stomach a genuine fat person in a the romantic lead? I'd like to think it was more because they didn't want to poke that much fun at a genuinely big girl, but I somehow doubt it...This is a movie to live your life by.","rw1133996","A wonderful, heart-warming film","pyx",1],[["6","12"],"Used Cars (1980)",null,"24 July 2005","Used Cars is a manic comedy that amuses for a time but finally wears out its welcome. The problem has a lot to do with director Robert Zemeckis, who reaches for a kind of screwball motor-mouth quality, but ends up steering the project in a needlessly coarse direction. Zemeckis knows how to bring flow to a movie, but his sense of comedy is not very finely-tuned. There's a lot of profanity in the movie, and general vulgarity, and Zemeckis's treatment of this material tends to emphasize its rudeness in the wrong way. He wants to get an Animal House sense of the sophomoric, but he doesn't have the touch necessary to make crudity fun. His characters aren't blissful vulgarians, they're just plain vulgar.The plot is basically an exercise in oneupmanship. Sleazy used car magnate Roy Fuchs wants to force his honest-but-poor brother Luke, also a used car dealer (their lots are right across the street from one another), out of business, thereby rescuing his own place from being demolished to make way for a new freeway ramp. The ruthless Roy hatches a plan to give the ailing Luke a heart attack; after the plan succeeds, Luke's hot-shot salesman, Rudy, takes over running the lot, and begins concocting any number of harebrained schemes in an attempt to defeat Roy, and help his own political ambitions (a politician who's literally a used-car salesman). Matters are complicated by the appearance of Barbara, Luke's long-lost daughter, who must be kept in the dark about her father's fate. There are dashes of satire along the way, little digs at Jimmy Carter and other relevant late-70s matters, but mostly the film is a flat-out farce, an escalating series of bizarre situations. The funniest gag concerns Rudy and his cronies' attempts to get publicity by hi-jacking the air-waves, first during a football game and then during a presidential address. The film is at its most anarchic during these scenes, which inevitably involve strippers and cuss-words, and manages to be sporadically chaotic the rest of the time. A lot of comic energy is spilled by everyone involved, sometimes too much. One big scene involving the salesmen's efforts to exploit their new-found publicity through a sales blitz degenerates into a frantic mess, and the climactic sequence involving 250 cars driven cross-country by student drivers just seems desperate.The only really memorable character in the movie is Rudy, played by Kurt Russell as a slick operator whose breathless selling hides the heart of a decent fellow. Jack Warden plays brothers Roy and Luke as diametric opposites, Roy an evil slime-ball and Luke a grandfatherly coot, and is only really funny when Luke is having a coronary. Deborah Harmon is a little too earnest as Barbara, though her off-beat look does seem right for the character. Where the movie really flops is in the key supporting performances: Gerrit Graham is mediocre as the superstitious Jeff, while Frank McRae edges into an uncomfortable area as the sleepy, foul-mouthed black mechanic Jim. The acting overall lacks the kind of nuance that might have been brought out by a director with more comic feel than Zemeckis. The situations are funny enough, and the writing is passable, but there's a sense to almost every scene that the gags are being overplayed. Zemeckis seems to have pushed the actors to be zanier, and louder, and more profane, when a more low-key approach might have served them better. The situations are outlandish enough that it's not really necessary to sell them much. Zemeckis's approach, however, is to sell everything harder, like he's hawking some old beater instead of a serviceable machine.","rw1133997","Over-Revved Car Comedy","aliasanythingyouwant",0],[["1","3"],"Hustle & Flow (2005)","10","24 July 2005","I thoroughly enjoyed this entrancing and engaging movie ... as did my two hip-hop loving sons, ages 22 and 23, respectively.No stereotypes, just a bunch of complex people with hopes and dreams like every one.

Besides the silly special affects and the strained script, the best part of this SCFI blockbuster is Dakota Fanning. Fanning who's only 11 years old upstages the great Tom Cruise with little trouble.But with this in mind, Spielberg still manages to keep the audience's attention like he's always managed to do.

These characters are all far from perfect, but then they never act so imperfect that they become imperfections or social outcasts - it was a fine line, I sat dreading and hoping bad things weren't about to happen. The characters are disconnected, and oddly intertwined. This film felt like a guilty pleasure and sitting next to my wife who didn't laugh once made me feel all the more guilty. What punctuates these uncomfortable moments with the kid's scenes are the adult's scenes - - these adults seem more like children. In fact, the naiveté of these adults is really a welcoming thing in this day and age of children growing up so soon. The adults view of the world reminds me of how David Byrne (of Talking Heads/True Stories) perceives the world - \"pieces and parts\" of interest, focusing on minutiae and the everyday \"stuff\", showing the absurd in the ordinary, while never condescending to any character.

This movie made my Sunday evening, and weekend as a whole. I mean, it's not a magnum opus, maybe a little creepy when you come to think of the concept - but the characterization and acting by the leads was just brilliant! Everything was so well crafted that you will exit from the movie theater with a smile. Unless you're weirder than weird, of course.While watching the movie, so many questions arose - Why a Scotsman (McGregor) is made to speak with an American accent? Why is he paired with a lady (Johannsen) 10 years younger to him. Guess what - even these silliest of answers get answered in the end! PROLOGUE: This is not a SPOILER. It's an explanation of how things are before the time-line of the movie begins. The setting is 2019. People have gotten richer, of course technology has advanced drastically, and the concept of cloning does exist. Noted celebrities, politicians, sports-persons desire to live a longer life and a career no matter what has to be done. Thus, there are clones created in a remote institute in Arizona run by an English scientist ,Merrick. Merrick and his staff basically take a complete scan of the client (called the \"investor\") and a clone of the same investor is created with the same physical and anatomical, yet closer to perfect, features. However, these clones, or \"insurance policies\" as they are called, are bred to only be killed eventually for their spare parts - lungs, heart, you name it, to be taken away and given to the investor to live longer. Until their termination time, they are fed on a very strict diet, and are only educated up to the level of a 15 year old. The clones are kept content in their inner lives by being told they were brought to the institute because they were \"contaminated\" in the real world and were getting cured from the same. They were also promised a lottery where a winner gets to go to the \"Island\" - where a new world is set to begin, new breeding, no pollution, etc. This is until a flaw occurs in the habilitation process and one product, Lincoln has questions....----------------------------- Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen were absolutely brilliant in their acting and carried the movie from beginning to the end. I was slightly disappointed when I saw the trailer earlier, and it implied that Scarlett was becoming a blonde bimbo of Hollywood - but I was wrong. She not only had a role to play, but played it well. Hope she becomes the next Hollywood superstar as she is a truly good actress, and charming in her own way.McGregor, on the other hand, carries his post-Star_Wars grace very well, and should be looking for some really dramatic and challenging roles in the near future to get an Oscar or some awards. He is a good actor, and is definitely no James Bond material - too down to earth as an actor (maybe not as a person) to play the cocky British spy. The supporting cast - Michael Clarke Duncan only had a few lines to spare and was a cry baby, but an OK role done. Djimon Honsou - Hollywood's only \"African\" actor played his role well and gracefully. Steve Buscemi is what one could call a struggling actor. I respect him for trying something new like playing a confused ex-con on a full season of the SOPRANOS - showed his less-comedy side which he portrays in Adam Sandler movies. In the Island, he did sort of fit the role of a crazy techie, but he needs to find something that will bring his recognition back up.Sean Bean, the smooth talking, English villain who played a James Bond baddie too early in his career, also carried his vicious role well. Would have been more appropriate to see an American Southerner play the role of the institute's head-honcho as it was set in Arizona. Overall I gave the movie 8/10.

The first was in Moulin Rouge.","rw1134005","A different Ewan McGregor","dickback",1],[["6","7"],"Huey Long (1985)","7","24 July 2005","Huey Pierce Long never became President of the United States. He hoped to, and (probably for the best) a gunshot stopped him. I say probably because there is considerable debate over him to this day.If you love democracy, with a balance of power approach as in the Federal Constitution (or the states for that matter) Long is an evil aberration. He used the normal methods of rising up the political ladder as a state railway commissioner, a state senator, Governor, and U.S. Senator. On his way up he found ways of reducing the opposition to a set of shrill, impotent voices, and of manipulating the state legislature, the judiciary, and the local governments to do what he wanted. For all intents and purposes Louisiana was a dictatorship under Huey. And once he got into the U.S. Senate, he planned to spread his influence until he was in the White House, and could do the same thing there.Therefore, his death by gunshot in the state capital building at Baton Rouge, La. on September 18, 1935, was a lucky break. Whether he was shot by Dr. Carl Austin Weiss (the son-in-law of an opponent who'd been racially smeared by Long) or by a trigger happy guard who was joining in the shooting of Weiss does not matter - he would have been bad news for American Democracy.But here's the problem. Huey did not come from a state that had a history of two party democracy. Most of the states in the south were dominated for decades by the Democratic Party (which was opposed to big business in theory, but also highly racist towards African-Americans and minorities). So when he studied how to get higher in office, he learned how his predecessors did it. He also noted the success of others in other states at turning them into fiefdoms - like Senator Hiram Johnson of California. Secondly, although his methods were crude and resembled fascist or communist models, Huey actually did do a lot of good for his state. One has to study the man's career in light of previous Democrats who were elected to public office. Huey came from the parishes - the back country, and knew the needs of the farmers (both white, Cajun, and black), and how they were neglected in favor of the large cities, particularly New Orleans and Baton Rouge. He was smart, and managed to get a college education, and eventually became a lawyer (a very good one - he actually argued before the U.S. Supreme Court). The Governors and the legislators and the judiciary were extremely conservative (the popular term in use was \"Bourbons\"). Huey, as he built up his machine, delivered services, such as roads and highways and power, to the countryside. He also improved school conditions for the countryside. While still willing to use racial slurs (as with Dr. Weiss's father-in-law) Huey actually got more jobs going for the African-American community. He could also display anti-Semitism when he wished, but when someone pointed out that when he did that he resembled Hitler, Huey became furious: \"Don't ever compare me to that son-of-a-bitch!\", he yelled, \"Every fool whose ever gone against those people has wrecked his state's economy!!\" Not a comment of love, but obviously of sense.Huey was an opportunist. To raise revenues in Louisiana he invited Lucky Luciano to install one armed bandits throughout the state. But he also could sacrifice for reasonable grounds. He signed a law reducing the cotton production from Louisiana to build up prices for the cotton outside the state.So he is not an easy figure to totally condemn or admire. Ken Burns documentary on \"the Kingfish\" (Huey used that name, based on a character on the radio show AMOS AND ANDY, for himself) gives a fairly good balanced view. Burns shows what was frighteningly close to happening, but he does show that Huey was more than a power seeker or a buffoon (as some enemies suggested). While not as detailed as the Burns documentaries on THE CIVIL WAR, JAZZ, or BASEBALL, it is a good place to start studying this remarkable political career.","rw1134006","The Kingfish, Warts and Glory","theowinthrop",0],[["0","1"],"Halloween (1978)","10","24 July 2005","Halloween was and is my all time horror movie i still watch it and know it by heart I've seen all 8 Halloween movies and wait #9 i always remember when Laurie and Annie where driving in car and don't fear the reaper came on Halloween was a novel before it came out in movie they have to find out why Micheal is the way he is i think that would make a good story for Halloween movie what ever happened to the Strodes Laurie's parents who will Micheal go after now since Laurie strode is dead her son who knows but ill see it Halloween was the beginning of the slasher flicks i think and every holiday started coming out after that and the sequels keep coming theirs Freddy Michael Chucky Jason Leatherface I've only seen one female sleep-away camp but shes really a","rw1134008","the night he came home","meagherdavid",0],[["3","8"],"Cannonball Run II (1984)","9","24 July 2005","A lot of people who rate movies here are missing the point....The movie stars in this picture rarely saw each other, so I'm sure that making this picture ( and part 1) was as much a social gathering and bunch of fun mixed together.I loved seeing everyone in this film- and am one person who loves the 'fun factor' and could care less about script or technical acting ability of the cast!(below is for the minimum length extension)A lot of people who rate movies here are missing the point....The movie stars in this picture rarely saw each other, so I'm sure that making this picture ( and part 1) was as much a social gathering and bunch of fun mixed together.I loved seeing everyone in this film- and am one person who loves the 'fun factor' and could care less about script or technical acting ability of the cast!","rw1134009","Lots of FUN","bandit44",0],[["1","3"],"Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)","6","24 July 2005","Director Doug Liman, who's gotten famous for making fun movies like \"Swingers\" and \"Go\" has successfully blended together action and comedy.In \"MR.and Mrs.Smith\" Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt star as John and Jane Smith a mild mannered couple with dark secrets.

In addition, the things he will do to himself in the bathroom scene in the courthouse as I found out no sound effects were used in that scene where he's actually slamming his head and body into walls, the radiator heater as ell as the toilet seat.If there are any drawbacks, Jim Carrey tends to overact a bit, but he's someone who can do it and get away with it.Jennifer TIlly's character, Samantha Cole, Fletcher's client was good, but this was different to me as she plays an evil person who wants to take her ex-husband to \"the cleaners\" in the divorce. I best remember her as Vicki in \"Let it Ride\".At the end, when the credits are rolled, various outtakes are shown and they are worth watching, as he's up to his usual craziness and even a prank is pulled on him.

Its usually a nice break from all the dramatic movies. But I have to say this was a total disaster. The film is filled with songs... at least 6-7 of them, almost never allowing the movie to ever maintain a flow. The storyline of the movie is pretty decent but a lot more could have been done with it to make the movie a whole lot better. Most of the movie was a drag, specially the second half. Sushmita Sen has done a great job and looks good as always, Salman Khan is getting pretty good at comedy, and Arshad Varsi is hilarious as usual. But barring maybe 25-30 minutes of funny original scenes, the movie is mostly a big waste of time. I would recommend to definitely wait till the DVD is released for watching the film.

Production values were outstanding. It seemed relatively slow-moving in terms of plot, more slice of life than fast-paced actions or twists and turns, but there was a real plot. This program was very dark in tone, not because of excessive violence, but because of its portrayal of a criminal subculture where no-one can be trusted or relied upon, where success is fleeting, and where even successes are hollow. Unlike Tarantino's gangster flicks or Japanese yakuza films, there are no amusing quirks of character or cartoonish elements to provide comic relief. The lead character has the expensive cars and clothes, and the trophy wife, but it's still not enough to fulfil his ambitions. His sneer of cold command and chilly, controlling demeanour suggests a total emotional vacuum. His wife can't stand his lifestyle, he doesn't even truly know his best friend, his gang consists of imbeciles and traitors, and the timid Irish accountant that he thinks he controls is actually putting the screws on him. The other gangsters he deals with are similarly disillusioned. One talks of how he hates his kids, another says that to him the 60's meant little fun and a lot of hard work. Nobody ends up feeling satisfied despite their desperate and dangerous striving, and perhaps this is what resonated with me so powerfully and made it so memorable.","rw1134020","Possibly the best TV drama mini-series I've seen","gut-6",0],[["1","3"],"Hustle & Flow (2005)","10","24 July 2005","The Story, as an original screenplay, could be considered for an Academy Award.

Casting was excellent; Michael Caine as Alfred was inspired, and he plays the part both with charismatic charm and with a deep empathy for Bruce Wayne and his demons. I didn't check out the cast list fully before seeing the movie, and I kept telling myself that the actor playing the young James Gordon looked really familiar... has Gary Oldman ever played a good guy before this? Hopefully they will continue to use him in the sequels (of course there will be those!) so we can see his eventual rise to police commissioner.It was great to see how human the man behind the mask is... that is something that Val Kilmer and George Clooney could not come across with (Michael Keaton did a better job of portraying Bruce Wayne as a tortured soul, but not was well as Bale did).And while I'm not a Bat addict, wasn't one of the villains named \"Scarecrow\" in the comic?

How disappointed I was to find myself waiting for the end of this tedious, hackneyed serial-killer plot. Before long I suspected that Conan Doyle had no connection with this story, apart from the name of the main characters, and from then on it became a game of 'spot the anachronisms', of which there were too many to count. Rupert Everett was okay, I suppose, but the splendid Ian Hart was completely wasted in this production. So unlike the dynamic partnership between Holmes and Waterson in 'Baskervilles'. By the time the story had dribbled to its silly conclusion, I had become convinced that it had originated from a recently written screenplay, so I scrutinised the credits, beginning and end, for any sign of 'Conan Doyle'. No, nothing. Not even a 'Based on characters created by'. I'm surprised that the script was written by the man who did the screenplay for 'Baskervilles'.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I will be discussing the winners of the events so don't read this if you don't want to see any spoilers!As usual, things kicked off with the swimming relay. Stepfanie Kramer was holding a very narrow lead for NBC when Mark Harmon buried the competition while swimming the third leg. Victory easily went to NBC in this event.Next up was the kayak race. Tony Danza (ABC Team) lost control of his kayak and went sideways, partially entering the CBS lane. He caused his team to fall quite a bit behind. Luckily, Tracy Scoggins kicked some major butt in the third leg and drove her team to an exciting come from behind victory. The CBS team was a poor sport about the whole thing and actually protested (even though their loss had nothing to do with the Danza fiasco). Sore losers...ABC wins this event.In this part of the broadcast Cosell tactfully interviews Tracy Scoggins and asks her if she is bothered by the fact that people consider her \"just a sexpot; no talent\". Good job for keeping things light Howie! The only full game showed in the football event was the final. NBC won in a very dull game 9-5. Mr. Cosell opened up his big mouth again when Jennifer O'Neill was injured in a qualifying match. He stated that everyone is familiar with the problems that she has endured over the years. However, \"in good taste does not want to discuss them in detail\". That's you Howie...a really classy guy brimming with good taste!Baseball dunk was next and Tony Lo Bianco's 3-for-3 performance led ABC to victory. Branda Vaccaro, noticeably absent from other events, took what seemed like a million years to get herself seated in the dunk tank. Everyone found it hilarious. Hmmm.The obstacle course was highlighted by Tracy Scoggins defeating Kim Fields twice and Harmon dominating the men's side of things. He easily defeated a klutzy Tony Danza in the final (he messed up twice).The tandem bicycle relay had NBC and ABC battling it out. That is until Tony Lo Bianco lost his footing and Mark Harmon (with Jane Badler) showed his athletic prowess yet again. Another event won by NBC.That set up a disappointing Tug of War final between NBC and ABC. It lasted under a minute and was predictably dominated by NBC. So there you have it.

What a phenomenally amazing movie!!! I have long been a fan of the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and the first \"Willy Wonka\" movie. That being said, I must say that I enjoyed \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" twice as much as the 1971 version. To begin with, the current version is more visually appealing. The sets were bright and colorful, and more in line with what you might expect from a reclusive genius' workplace. I loved the back story explaining Willy's great love for chocolate and why he was so determined to make it big in the chocolate business. But all of that would be meaningless if the acting was less than great. Fortunately, all of the performances were tremendous!!!! No kidding!!!! Every single one, from Charlie's bed-ridden grandparents to the chocolate master himself. Most notably, Freddie Highmore was cute as a button from his mud spattered high-water pants to his adorable dimpled cheeks. He brought a purity and innocence to his role that was very genuine. All of the other kids were deliciously annoying, as were their parents, which made you realize why the kids were so disgustingly bratty. The oompa-loompas were a scream, and I thought replicating one person to portray lots of oompa-loompas was a very clever and creative touch. The musical numbers were hilarious, without the in your face moralism of the 1971 variety. But I save my greatest praise for Willy Wonka himself, the truly great Johnny Depp. I know he seemed a little creepy, but wouldn't anyone be after being alone in a chocolate factory for 15 years with nothing but oompa-loompas for company?!!? Johnny Depp provided just the right amount of weirdness and sensitivity to the role and has proved himself again to be one of the greatest actors of our time. Mr. Depp never disappoints!!! This movie was a treat for so many reasons. I was very happy to see that Tim Burton toned down the tunnel ride.

Listen to the narrator in the prologue as he tells of the history of the ring and Gollum. That alone is so much more poignant and emotional than 99% of the acting,and I use the term loosely for Liv Tyler and Sean Astin, etc., in the Jackson films.(Which I did like, by the way, I just didn't love those films)John Hurt is great as Aragorn, as are the other voices, and the animation, though extraordinarily trippy, creates a dark foreboding mood.One of the most important differences between the films as well, is that in the Bakshi version Gandalf is portrayed as wise, cunning, and almost having an incredible influence and hand in all of the actions of Middle Earth. The Gandalf in the Jackson films, though played by an excellent actor in Ian Mckellan was cast as a dottering old man who bumped into things and did not have the foresight and all encompassing breadth of vision that the Bakshi Gandalf did.Also, the Balrog in the Bakshi and Jackson versions serves as a microcosm of why the Bakshi version works on a more mystical level. In the Jackson version, the Balrog looks like a CGI ridden, no personality, bull faced, not realistic thing from a Godzilla movie. The one in the Bakshi version, though not as done with effects, has much more of a depth of character, and it exists as a realistic villain rather than Gigan, Mothra, etc.The score in the Bakshi version is infinitely superior to the Enyaesque stylings of Jackson. I mean, when you are watching the Bakshi version the score sways and segways the film, whereas the feeling during the Jackson films is; okay I am sitting in a theater watching this,and now they are playing Enya over it.All in all, despite the MANY things Jackson got right, and the many things he got wrong, the Bakshi version succeeds where the Jackson version does not in the most important and, in the end, vital way.

What I mean is that the movie focuses more on a small group of men and their fears and problems than it does on a grand plan for Allied victory. It's a very personal movie. We get to see these men up-close and we begin to develop feelings for them. I wouldn't doubt that this is one of the first films to show a U.S. Lieutenant so battle scarred that he resorts to using pain killers just to function. Unlike other war films of this era, not all of these men are going to make it to the end. War is like that. It doesn't pick and chose people to live because we like them. So in that regard, it's also more realistic than some other war movies made in the 50s.To succeed as a small, personal war movie as I've described, the cast has to be able to act. This cast does not disappoint. Richard Widmark, Jack Webb, and Karl Malden are all excellent in their respective roles. I was especially impressed with Webb who has an acting style that can grate on the nerves. He's more subdued here and it works. But as good as these three are, Jack Palance is the highlight of the movie for me. He was undoubtedly the most believable.

It's difficult to understand how the man who gave us the charm of E.T. and the humanity of Close Encounters could deliver such pathetic junk. The biggest problem in this film is a script so lacking in coherency that it's writing seems better suited to one of those bad 50's B sci-fi movies. (I think I just heard H. G.

Cruise's daughter is so annoying I almost wished one of the tripods would put that screeching presence out of her misery. And what's with Tim Robbins? His hammy performance was the only true bit of humor to be found anywhere.Granted, the special effects are great and one should not expect any big statement on the human condition from big budget sci-fi, but we're talking Spielberg here. One anticipates not only a good show but a superior narrative from a good storyteller. On the positive side, the director goes for a much grittier look (a la Saving Private Ryan) which is appropriate for the subject matter. However, maybe the movie would have worked better had it expanded the story to involve more characters and encompassed more the broader effect of the invasion outside of Cruise's family.All in all, a total waste of talent and an even clunkier mess than the marauding invading aliens.","rw1134034","E.T.

It was actually the first attempt to present a more realistic view -- albeit by white men -- of the \"human element\" in what had been built up to outlandishly perverted stereotypes about Black people, and the projects. There were definitely stereotypes and caricatures in this series as there were in all sitcoms that had any aspirations of getting past their pilot episode.The cons were actually pretty minimal given the fact that no matter what was presented to the white public there was always going to be a twisting of what the actors and writers were attempting to convey, mostly because of a combination of ignorance and bigotry. It was a no-win situation, and personally I couldn't possibly have cared less what white people got out of the show. If I'm not mistaken, there was a much much larger white following of The Cosby Show than there was for Good Times. And we'll just attribute that to the \"comfort factor.\" The reality is that a whole lot of folks all across the country living in ghettos and projects are hard-working, law-abiding, church/mosque-going people who are committed to family. And yeah there's also crime. Anywhere you pile people on top of each other in crappy situations you're going to see crime.JJ was a caricature but he was also a very talented artist.James Sr. was a loving husband and father and a strong, intense, proud Black man. The fact that he threatened (but never followed through) is part of a language difference; too bad some folks couldn't see the overall makeup of this character as a loving, supportive father and husband. He was also a dark-skinned, African-featured actor in a positive role, and I'm frankly impressed they didn't cast someone with more \"palatable\" features for the white audience (you know, Harry Belafonte or goofy non-threatening faces like Bill Cosby).Florida was a full-figured, dark-skinned, African-featured woman who was depicted as an intelligent, strong, attractive, complex, and desirable WOMAN, which was most definitely a first in what had been and would continue to be the old plantation standard of beauty and the narrow role assignments generally given to women of Esther Rolle's stature.I'm still laughing about the comment that Thelma dressed like a slut! Hah! She dressed like a frickin' school teacher for ...well, any decade from the 60's to now.Many of the political commentary that was slipped in was done around Michael's dialogue with other characters, and usually it was done well.Bookman was a casualty of bad writing and a sloppy solution to a consistent antagonist. You could probably blame Jay Leno if you wanted. He and David Letterman were writers for the show, if memory serves.All in all there were positive messages within the body of the series and the character-driven episodes, and they were able to universalize many aspects of daily life and the nuclear - and extended - family.Of course there was offensive stuff in it too. There's no possible way to get everything right, please everybody, or avoid insulting somebody along the way.

There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it can't be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter doesn't know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it's still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he's just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.","rw1134042","The Origin of Horror","moviemanMA",0],[["0","4"],"Sideways (2004)","10","24 July 2005","I have seen all the big movies of 2004 now and I am convinced this one is the best, and an all-time excellent piece off work.

They say that comedy is harder than drama. How about a combination of comedy and drama that really works? How about such a combination, where the lead characters are not very attractive? Giamatti is excellent, but so is Clark. Lots of acting with little glances and subtle body movements. Madsen is perfectly cast and her character well-played. Many find that the interaction between Miles and Maya is not credible. It seems to me that Maya and Miles are both more than deep enough for this to resemble real life more than the movies.This may not be the most profound movie ever made, and it may not advance movie-making on a technical or technique level, but this is a very good film, all around.","rw1134043","Best of 2004","cstrother-1",0],[["0","3"],"The Ladykillers (1955)","10","24 July 2005","A long, long time ago (actually, only half a century ago) in a galaxy far, far away (okay, it was in this galaxy, on this planet), Obi Wan Kenobi was known as Alec Guinness, and he made some great movies, including \"The Ladykillers\".

I had to run the gauntlet of a bunch of bleating, ill-informed animal activists who were making false claims that the organisers of the film festival were supporting a 'cat snuff film'. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is NOT a 'cat snuff film' - such claims would be laughable if they were not completely ridiculous and untrue.I find such premature condemnation irritating in the extreme. It is as clear as there is a nose of your face that the people so strongly opposed to this documentary have not a single clue as to what it actually contains. It does NOT contain the graphic components of the cat killing film in question. It does feature, however, a detailed and confronting written description of the film's content, by way of a written scroll giving a minute-by-minute description of its content. The audience is thankfully spared the real footage of the crime.Casuistry: The Art of Killing a Cat is a documentary, pure and simple - and I found it a very well balanced and objective one for that matter. It was very thought provoking. It features interviews with the cat killing criminals, as well as animal activists and an investigating policeman, among many others. It also highlights the killer's defence that it was some sort of 'work of art', especially given that one of them had previously made other films depicting animal cruelty in the name of 'art'.There is some footage of one of the killer's earlier film 'art' works, including dancing with the corpse of a pig obtained from an abattoir, and a peculiar music video featuring dancing skinned animals from a research laboratory. Perhaps the most confronting was the short depiction of the beheading of a small live chicken. All of this imagery was presented in context, and was neither condoning the acts, nor suggestive of such inclusions as being some form of entertainment. It was featured in this documentary to balance out the killer's argument that the filming of the cat's torture was not a precedent setter, but one that had occurred within the context of his previous 'art works' - a nonsense argument in my opinion.As a viewer, I was left feeling a sense of scorn and pity upon the perpetrators of this act - one of whom seemed to frequent minimise the severity of it, with lines of argument such as: \"well, we were drugged out\" and \"we kill animals for meat, so what's the problem\". They seemed mainly well spoken and articulate individuals, but ones that seemed to lack a sense of morality, consequence, responsibility and a honed capacity for knowing when to draw the line with certain reasonable or acceptable behaviours. I think most reasonable adults would agree that the deliberate infliction of real pain on human or animal, regardless of intent, is a tad bit intolerable.Speaking of what is intolerable, the session I attended contained a hefty presence of police and security personnel, after the cinema received some veiled threats. If animal activists think that threatening innocent cinema-goers - who are merely exercising their right to see what they wish - somehow increases the validity of their arguments, then they are sorely misguided and utterly deluded.","rw1134045","I cannot see what all the fuss is about...","johnnycourageous",1],[["10","10"],"One of My Wives Is Missing (1976 TV Movie)","10","22 July 2005","I saw this movie several years ago and I never forgot it.

You might be tempted to walk out in the first 20 minutes, which seem artless and aimless: not very fascinating people making not very fascinating small talk in drab settings. The by-default protagonist, Marnie (Kate Dollenmayer), is a listless 23-year-old between jobs and quietly smitten with an old friend, Alex (Christian Rudder), who has just broken up with his girlfriend. Does Alex like her? Other friends, among them Alex's sister, don't quite know. Alex, it seems, doesn't quite know. Marnie doesn't communicate her affections very forcefully. In fact, she does nothing very forcefully. She drinks a little at parties, she lies around, she hangs out with laid-back friends, and she floats.Floating, indecision, the indefinite: This is the gray arena of Funny Ha Ha. The surprise is how the movie comes together and gets under your skin before you even know why you should give a damn. What seems improvised and random turns out to be controlled, at times cunningly shaped, and the surface of nonsequiturs and random shrugs conceals fairly intense emotionsthe emotions of self-consciously cool, easy, inarticulate people afraid to pin anything down. The nonaction is set (in what appears to be Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville) in midsummer and has a midsummer formlessnessan extension of the kind of languor you feel in those hazy dog days before the sudden hardness and definition of fall.Dollenmayer becomes more and more fun to read. A young woman with long limbs and sleepy eyes on a big, open face, she's just the sort of beauty whose self-effacing vibe would make her less than magnetic to really handsome guys and madly irresistible to nerdswho think that maybe, just maybe, they'd have a shot. The one she attracts is played by the director, who makes himself look very unprepossessing, indeed. In fact, he's cringe-worthy. The character he plays, Mitchell, tries to make a virtue of his self-deprecation: Loathing himself is obviously all he has to think about. He's so unappealing that it really would be a sign of self-disrespect for Marnie to go to bed with him. Fortunately, he's too lame even to press his case. But she'd be no better off with adorable Alex, whose boneless diffidence seems increasingly selfish and calculated.Funny Ha Ha is a bit of a stunt. How can intelligent people, even slackers, be this vaporous? No one talks about life, the world, politics, music, moviesanything concrete.

It was much more balanced, non-judgmental and rational than it could have been and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The performances in the movie are good. Sharon Lawrence provides an excellent portrayal of the elder woman and gives her character a unique amount of personality, depth and insight which allows the viewer to feel empathy and perhaps in some cases some sympathy for her point of view and the emotions she is going through. She is also exceedingly beautiful and vivacious and that also gives a realistic dimension to this role. Brian Austin Green is also excellent in the role of Paul –he gives the character enough passion, sensitivity and realism to make you also relate and identify with the feelings and emotions that he is experiencing. The supporting cast is also excellent –with John Getz, Ashleigh Aston Moore and Katie Wright all portraying their characters exceptionally and with perfection. The only disappointing character in my opinion was the character of Paul's mother –somehow her character seemed a bit too flat and one-dimensional. Perhaps this was biased by the fact that I didn't like her character but I still think she could have been handled better The script and dialogue in this movie flow well and avoids the trap evident in a considerable number of telemovies of becoming too clichéd or unrealistic. The issues involved in the movie are discussed and treated in a professional way and the consequences of the actions of all the characters involved are evaluated thoughtfully. I actually sympathized with the teenager and Sharon Lawrence's character here –being attracted to older woman myself –but the movie was wonderful at allowing me to see the other side of the picture. That's what I enjoyed so much about this movie –it didn't seek to pass judgment or editorialize about the actions of the main characters. It just let the story unfold quite close to the way that it probably would have in real life.I was disappointed with the ending of this film –which I won't reveal-but, like an early reviewer here, I agree that many would see it as a logical conclusion.

It's not at all like a modern movie. It has title screens and actors using overly broad gestures and overacting in a nearly comical manner. They also sing in an artificial stylized semi-operatic manner. It combines the style of a silent movie with a stage production of an operetta. It is obviously from another age, but it only takes a few minutes before you accept the strange style and simply relax and enjoy it. The available DVD was obviously made from a print that came from barely salvageable deteriorating celluloid. The video quality is terrible and the sound quality is merely bad. In spite of all these problems, the movie is worth watching over and over. The comic scenes are amusing. The bad editing and overdrawn acting is mildly amusing, too. The music is fabulous and you soon relax and begin to love wallowing in the corn. The plot? Think of it as \"Zorro goes to Morocco\" and it was probably at least some of the inspiration for Superman (hero with a secret identity who wears a red cape, etc.). The 1953 version is more easily available, but much of the music and plot was gutted to try to make it a bit more \"cool\" in 1950's terms. Unfortunately, the sacrifices removed much of what made the original production work musically and emotionally. I prefer the older version and just wish there was a better print available. If you have any interest in classic operetta, this is a \"do not miss\" film.

Gone With the Wind.Mask? Well, Peter Bogdonavich isn't exactly a no-name director. Give him a great screenplay and you might just be surprised. I am no big Cher fan, as applies to her acting, but in my opinion it was her best performance ever. Same with Eric Stoltz (Rocky). Stoltz has been doing his thing for 30 years and I have never seen one of his characters that wasn't believable. The guy is \"uber-talented\" and a true professional. This was tough role. He didn't act from *behind* the mask - he had to act *through* the mask. That requires acting at another level of complexity.Sam Elliot (Gar) was believable for me as Cher's (Florence's)love interest and a biker leader. Some may say that all that biker stuff was over the top. I found it convincing. Bikers can seize on a cause with the jaws of a pit bull and be relentless in their support. This was, to me, a really believable situation.The Diana character (Laura Dern) was very welcome and sweet, but I do have a hard time believing that she had not been exposed to some of the concepts that Rocky worked on with her (colors and shapes). She came across as too smart for this stuff to have been a new concept, especially after seeing her parents, who did not seem to be idiots. At the same time, the parents were TOTALLY unbelievable characters. Their daughter, who they obviously love, has a disability, but they are totally repulsed by Rocky and his. It rarely works this way in real life.I do have to sum up with this: If at the end of the movie you did not cry - with real, liquid tears that you could feel with your hand, then you need to call the police right now and turn yourself in as at least a potential (if not actual) serial killer. Just sit on the steps of the front porch and wait for them to get there. Unless you're a certified something-or-other, is simply NOT POSSIBLE to watch the whole movie, and see the ending scene where Cher comes into Rocky's room after finding out he wasn't at school, and not get swept up into that emotion.","rw1134064","A Real Classic","dtburr",0],[["4","5"],"Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914)","7","24 July 2005","A series of amusing scenarios that as a feature film don't quite gel: as others have commented here, seeing the same slapstick gags over and over again can get monotonous. Still, some of the set pieces are quite amusing, the one featuring Marie Dressler (who looks like a cross between Mrs. Potato Head and Fatty Arbuckle in drag here) getting tipsy on a sip of alcohol, the movie within a movie and the spoof of exhibition dancing being among the highlights. Although modern viewers may come to this film expecting it to be a Chaplin feature (who atypically plays a villain), it is in fact very much Marie Dressler's filmmost of the film's comedy comes from watching the sometimes aggravating but essentially innocent Tillie flailing about like a giant, goggle eyed baby as she tries to cope with her unscrupulous gigolo lover and life in the big city. The film also does a sly take on that hoary leftover Victorian cliché, the distant wealthy uncle who conveniently dies: here the uncle rather inconveniently comes back to life (\"not so darn dead after all\" as a title card dryly observes). The film also features Mabel Normand as Chaplins' moll girlfriend (her petite beauty makes her a good foil for Dressler), and the Keystone Cops.","rw1134065","uneven but entertaining","pocca",1],[["0","2"],"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)","5","24 July 2005","I knew the reviews on this flick were going to be split 50/50 love/hate. So I'll try to stick one in the middle.For lovers of the original, do not go into this movie expecting the Wilder version. You WILL be disappointed. The similarities will make you expect the same warm feelings, but for some reason, you might leave the theater cold, and maybe angry.It was a colorful film, and there was some good acting, but the menacing, mysterious Wonka is definitely missing. Maybe it wasn't Depp's fault, but with the combination of makeup, script, and character development, we end up with what everyone else is calling a androgynous Jacko-Wonka. Depp doesn't have that semi-psychotic explosiveness that Wilder's Wonka had. Depp's character is more true to the book, but let's face it, Wilder's Wonka makes the audience fear and love him at the same time. With Depp, you have a non threatening wise cracking, high pitched Wonka. Adults will make the connection to Michael Jackson, but it is doubtful that the kiddies will. Highmore does an excellent job with Charlie, and isn't as annoying as the original Charlie. His family also has more interaction. As far as the kids: Augustus was improved, much funnier; Veruca,..well, honestly the original Veruca definitely seemed more like a spoiled little brat, so you were happier to see her go; Mike TV is annoying in both films, however, I kinda liked the original's Jay Leno-ish lisp. The implementation of video games for the new Mike will probably connect better with kids though; Violet was definitely improved, and her mom was just creepy, but thats good.The beloved familiar songs are gone, and while the lyrics of the new soundtrack might be clever and humorous, the accompanying music is too loud and cluttered to hear it. While I was watching, I noticed that most songs ended without a chuckle from the audience, and I attribute that to them being inaudible. The effects were well done, a nice surprise in this era of crap CGI laziness in Hollywood. The Oompas are all the same character, which honestly doesn't really bug me that much. The music is what let me down. I like the background on the Oompas, it added a little fresh air to the movie, and gave you something new, and not redone.You definitely get a little more knowledge of Wonka's background as well as Charlie's family, including a dad that was not present in the first flick. I thought the background story was good, however, it was not presented in a timely fashion. It's hard for this film to compete with the original, just on nostalgic value alone. The original is a bona fide classic, and even though technology has changed, it is not the most important factor. Especially in a movie that is supposed to tug at your heart strings, as well as dazzle your eyes.Children will love it, and maybe cherish it when they are older, as the older generations now cherish the '71 version. But us older folks might leave the theater disappointed, noticing Hollywood's greedy hands as they stick their hands in our pockets while trying to distract us with 'amazing' CGI. Don't get me wrong, like I said before, the CGI was good, and the sets were great, but there was something missing, something needed to draw you in and captivate your imagination. I went into this with a solid confidence that if anyone could or should redo the original, the Burton/Elfman/Depp crew were the ones to do it. I've been a huge fan of the trio since I can remember, and have had, and will continue to have faith in their creativity and vision. Corpse Bride looks awesome, and I'm sure Burton will redeem himself with that one.This is a delicate anomaly of a movie to review, so I'll end with this: Don't see it if you want to see a new, improved original. See it if you are taking your kids and family. The joy that they will get from it might stir up the joy you got from the original, just in case the new one doesn't tickle your fancy.","rw1134066","For a different generation","Zombafyed",1],[["3","8"],"The Devil's Rejects (2005)","3","24 July 2005","Having enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses more than any other horror movie I have ever seen I went to see Devil's Rejects with very high expectations from Zombie. I was very disappointed. The use of strong language, which was employed wonderfully in the first film, was over used and eventually completely superfluous to the film itself. And while the violence was as brutal as you would expect from Zombie it seems his imagination ran dry in this second film. You can only be shocked so many times by the sight of a fleshy human mask. Even the characters were not as involving or interesting as they had been in the first film. If it had not been for Sid Haig giving us the Captain Spaulding we came to love from the first movie, it would have been completely worthless. Portions of the film seem to drag on endlessly, especially the scene with the movie expert rattling on and on about the Marx Brothers. I left the theatre feeling almost cheated; the invincible and completely insane characters, which were charming in the first film, had become these motiveless violent foul-mouthed vigilantes that I was loath to watch for two hours. In summation, Rob Zombie took a wonderful cult horror movie and added to it an insidious sequel that is not worth the price of admission.

And I have to say, in defense of 'Killer Shrews' that there is just a hint of something good in this amusing period piece.Let's get a few things out of the way, right up front: The special effects for the title monsters are completely laughable (hand puppets for the close up shots and dogs covered with bath mats for the master shots). And not only do two of the main players have nearly impenetrable accents, the whole film is miked so badly that you can barely catch two words out of every three. The film takes forever to get started, and the first 20 minutes of the film is so static and badly blocked that you want to leave the room yourself to break things up and add some variety. The photography is grainy, badly lit black-and-white, especially in the indoor scenes. Some of the acting is strictly from Amateur Hour (especially the blond beauty pageant winner who we are asked to believe is a research scientist), and the rest of the acting is at the mercy of the plot and the director. The denouement, where the surviving cast members tie together a bunch of barrels that just *happen* to be in their backyard, get under the barrels and essentially barge past the shrews to the beach front - is so silly and badly done that you can't help but chuckle (including some of the most badly staged 'fake walking' you will ever see in a movie). And yet, there is some fun to be had here. The screenplay works mightily to establish an airtight, claustrophobic, no-way-out scenario for the cast. Best's character is articulate and resourceful in a 50's monster movie kind of way. Ken Curtis pulls out all the stops to portray a completely unsympathetic alcoholic, coward, back-shooting Judas and full time punching bag for James Best. The character actor who plays the absent-minded assistant professor actually imbues the role with a certain pleasant humanity and decency in spite of the cardboard nature of the role. There IS a palpable tension, and even anxiety and dread, in some of the scenes that manages to last in spite of the tons of exposition that get piled into the first half of the movie. Three stars out of 10. I can't rate it any lower than that in spite of the relatively low quality because I actually ended up kind of liking it in spite of all its faults - unlike many denizens of the Bottom 100, it tries to be about something, and has a certain innocence and enthusiasm that leavens the silliness and cheapness of the proceedings.","rw1134071","Amusing period piece with glints of potential under all the rubbish","lemon_magic",1],[["1","2"],"Army of Darkness (1992)","9","24 July 2005","If the title of this comment didn't make you want to see the movie, maybe these will: Zomibies, shotguns, chainsaws, exploding arrows, evil twins, and time travel.

When Mad Dog rides into the warehouse and dismounts his bike (and kills) is also stylish and noteworthy. Out of the three John Woo movies I have (A Better Tomorrow-excellent; Once A Thief-meh and Hard Boiled), I'd have to put ABT slightly ahead of this one because of the storyline and Mark's restaurant assassination is my all time favourite gun scene.

Burroughs fanatic).Likewise with Crash, a movie that will have you saying 'what the hell was that all about?' for the rest of the day after watching it, unless you already dig the psychotic, proto-rivet-head literary musings of J.G.

Of course, if you do, then the film won't give you anything new, just provide eve candy to supplant a work you're already familiar with.If you're a fanboy of the dementedly surreal and Cronenberg's perversely postmodern take on social commentary, you'll probably end up with this in the film library; if not, you'll probably be demanding your rental fees back.In a nutshell: like much of Cronenberg's stuff - not guaranteed to make sense to anyone but Cronenberg himself, caveat emptor.","rw1134083","It. helps to read the books, but that's not necessarily a good thing..","databeast",0],[["1","1"],"Peter en de vliegende autobus (1976)","8","23 July 2005","I have this movie on video.It's a nice kids movie.

There's more to the movie than the previews imply. The action is exciting, the characters are rather more developed than I expected, and the plot is sufficiently complex as to be interesting. But it still has flaws. Biggest among them, if you know anything at all about aircraft you'll have to completely turn off your mind's capacity for critical thought in order to enjoy the movie. It would take pages to list all the technical inaccuracies. The worst was probably the midair refueling blimp. Yes, that's right, blimp. Second was probably the vast area these small aircraft cover on 1 refueling; from a carrier in the eastern pacific, they to the India/Pakistan region, then into Russia, then to Siberia, then Alaska, and then back to the southeast Pacific, all in a matter of a few hours.

Very good movie. Despite the fact that it's about four brothers avenging their mothers death, there is a lot of humor in it. The brothers give each other sh*t all the time, but you can tell they love each other. Mark Whalberg (sp?) did a good job, but i think my favorite character was Jackie, played by Garrett Hedlund. There was a lot of action, a lot of violence, very graphic, but it was well done and believable. Not exactly a movie for children, but it's a family movie.

Seeing a dirty, decrepit, drunken man like bukowski in the lead role might have made this movie mildly interesting, but instead we have this overacting pretty boy horribly miscast. Additionally, the rest of the casting was equally atrocious-more watered down acting from the likes of Marissa Tomai, etc. If you want to see the real Bukowski on screen check out Barfly, which is not perfect, but much better, or better yet try to track down the old documentary video called ¨Bukowski drinks, smokes, and talks,¨ which has candid footage of bukowski boozing, chain smoking, driving around the sleaziest parts of LA and yelling at his girl friend.

Instead of giving the child interviewees a voice and a chance to talk about their lives before and during their military boarding school, this director serves us a series of narrated pathos-embedded statements depicting their awful backgrounds. As the homeless boys in the film are clearly working on restoring their crushed egos by trying to function progressively as group members in an institution accepted and respected by the society they live in, this immature, socio-pornographic primadonna comes with her pathological need to throw Gothic sensations out of her poetic dirt-bag. How little can a person understand the ashamed mind of the homeless and rejected and still be allowed to direct documentaries about this subject?

The only redeeming part of it was the last few minutes, man, Barbara Hershey still looks hot at 51! A movie has to pass two tests to get a good rating with me: (1.) A good, interesting plot, no fast forwarding to get past the boring parts. Has to keep my interest all the way through. (2.) A good ending, easy to understand, so I'm glad I watched it. Drowning on Dry Land failed both tests.Probably at least 20 percent of the movie was scenes that could easily be fast-forwarded through without missing a thing. Long scenes of driving along the highway, or someone simply walking along a road. The scene with the flat tire could be completely excised, no one would miss it.The ending? How did it end?

Here's what I got from the movie. (1) - Shaukat plays a control freak to the hilt, who feels like his ability to artistically create something carries over to reality. He fools himself into truly believing in the power of his work, that he's so talented he somehow has the ability to not only control his wife's actions, but also her innermost thoughts and feelings. When Shaukat realizes that he can't control Antara (I can't believe I still remember these names, by the way - I haven't seen the film since opening night back in Feb) he goes insane and loses his own grip on reality. (2) - I don't know why anyone would be interested in this cautionary tale for artists- I think the point of the movie for artists is to realize that you can't take your work so seriously as to have it control you to such an extent as Shaukat did. Realistic, natural art can't be manufactured, it flows from within. He can't forcefully create a love affair between Antara and Yash because this isn't in his control. He's so wrapped up in making a \"realistic\" story after such extreme critical rejection that he tries to force a situation that naturally can't occur. When he realizes that he's ultimately powerless, he loses his mind. Lets look at Shaukat's motivations besides his need for critical success and the desire for the power to make situations happen - his desire to \"play god\" so to speak. Abstract notions aside, I think Shaukat was also bored with his marriage and his life. He marries his student who appears to be a mysterious and beautiful young woman. He sees her as this enigma, a woman who he thinks will always be able to keep him on his toes, guessing. Antara doesn't turn out this way. She turns out to be a simple girl who eventually becomes a professor and falls into a life of predictability in marriage and work. Shaukat's notion of women is anything but simple - his character Tamanna is supposedly based on how he views his wife- mysterious, sexy, beautiful, and ultimately conniving and manipulative. But this is NOT the woman simple Antara really is. He wants to make her into something she's not because he's bored with the real Antara, so he sets out to spice up his marriage through his work by throwing this character based on what he WANTS his wife to be into an affair with Yash. Antara really doesn't enter into an affair with Yash, only managing to stay friends with him and turning him away at the end. So Shaukat fails to recreate his wife's personality and make his wife and marriage more interesting - another ironic reality he can't seem to face. She tells Shaukat in the beginning, while he's having writers block, \"Don't look for your story in me, I'm just a simple woman with simple dreams.\" He doesn't want the simple woman, he wants the temptress he imagines in his writings. Unfortunately for Antara, he prefers Tamanna, evidenced by the her sexy dance he imagines at the restaurant while they're dancing to \"Sholon Si.\" He sees the temptress Tamanna dancing seductively to the music surrounded by men rather than his boring, docile wife Antara, who only manages to submissively slow-dance with him. Ultimately, Shaukat can't face the fact that he's a loser, professionally as a writer and personally as a bored husband. He wants a certain lifestyle of the flashy, sensual, and mysterious wife and a hotshot career as a writer. He ends up a reclusive failed writer living in seclusion and falling into a life of marital boredom. Antara and Shaukat's dance at the end in the asylum is his submission to these facts and willingness to try to accept the ordinary life he has rather than the exciting life he covets.This is a beautiful story of a man who wants too much from life and ends up not getting any of it. It's rather cruel in a way, this writer is given an initial taste of success and a life of fame, only to have it taken away.The performances, barring Zayed Khan who was awkwardly terrible were excellent. Aishwarya plays two different characters - Antara, the vulnerable woman and Tamanna, the bewitching, mysterious, and conniving fantasy Shaukat wants Antara to be. She does both characters remarkably well and with a lot of subtle facial nuances. Her facial expressiveness brings a level of depth to both characters. Sanjay Dutt is brilliant as the alpha-male writer who refuses to accept mediocrity in life and in work. His presence is commanding. No one could have played Shaukat the way he did. Maybe if Bachchan was younger, he'd have the style and panache to do it, but no one else in my opinion. Dutt has that movie-star arrogance and charisma to make the role believable. And he has some smoldering chemistry with Aishwarya Rai. I've never seen Aish look so alluring with another male costar - she's like a block of ice with everyone else. But it looks like she's got a thing for Sanjay with the way they interact on screen. What a great looking couple. The film is beautifully shot, like a wonderfully dark painting. Everything looks classy and gorgeous, especially the songs. The movie may have been confusing but if you take the time to really explore these characters and the untold motivations behind these characters and their actions. It's all there, you just have to think about it and look hard enough. Art is subjective, even if you don't agree with my interpretation, you'll still take something of your own away from the movie.

It is a human theme and it is therefore easy to connect to when it is shown screen. For this reason, a number of viewers will perhaps take well to this film. However, those same people would take well to an average run-of-the-mill telepic that deals with the same issues, as this film is no better than such productions. Although the ideas and issues are easy to relate to, the same stuff has been explored in many other films, many times before, and the fashion that they are presented in here is very hackneyed. The characters are never better than ordinary, and they are even a tad annoying to have on screen. There is also a severe under-development of Joan Allen's character, as we see her angry, but we do not see her before she changes, and therefore there is no contrast: no visible change. Allen has received a lot of praise for being so angry and stressed, but she is never not - so she is just playing one emotional type - and I cannot call that a good performance myself. The rest of the cast deliver reasonably well, but there are no great performances.

The camera work is at times stunning, putting us not just right on stage at the Grey Fox Festival, but intimately close to instruments played expertly and with great affection. The offerings by Dobro virtuoso Jerry Douglas are by themselves worth the price of the DVD.The directors have inexplicably included a grating scene of a New Age wedding which not only adds absolutely nothing to the film, but detracts from it. One can only speculate as to why they deemed this worthy of our attention, but omitted any portrayal of the hymns and Sunday morning Gospel sings which are integral to the genre, and which grace almost every bluegrass festival I've ever heard of.The unfortunate wedding scene notwithstanding, \"Bluegrass Journey\" is a worthwhile tribute to a truly American art form.","rw1134125","Not quite perfect","hrhqueene",0],[["3","3"],"Steve Vai: Live at the Astoria London (2003 Video)","7","24 July 2005","What can I say? Steve Vai is a god. I bought this DVD after seeing Steve live in April in Toronto. Despite being mostly an instrumentalist, Steve Vai has a compelling stage presence, and he is in excellent form on this DVD. Not only is he the best, the rest of his band are very skilled musicians and some of the best. Billy Sheehan is simply put, an incredible bassist. Tony Macalpine is a shredder capable of playing some of Steve's hardest lines, but that's not just it, his keyboard skill may even surpass his guitar playing. Dave Weiner is another good guitar player who plays most of the rhythm. And finally, Virgil Donati provides a strong back bone to the whole thing, being a very intense drummer (he also has a drum solo, which starts a little slow, but when it builds up it is amazing). The set is great and contains most of his best songs. The highlights (in my opinion) are: Erotic Nightmares (one of my personal faves), Blue Powder, Little Wing, The Crying Machine, The Animal, Jibboom and The Attitude Song. A Vai tradition, Steve brings up Eric Sardinas (his opening man, also a very good guitar player) for the Attitude Song and extended soloing ensues from all players (at this moment, 4 guitarists and a bassist!). It is also noteworthy that Steve reproduces all effects heard in songs (remember the weird interlude in Blue Powder?). Along with his own songs, two Sheehan songs, two Hendrix covers, a classical piece and Dave Weiner's solo are included. Also, listen to the beginning of Fire where Steve talks about Britney Spears. This is also a trend with him, we got to hear about Britney at the Toronto concert, Heh. If you have any interest in guitar, BUY THIS.

Marina Levtoza (who later went on to star in what was a bigger box office success, yet inferior critical success, 'President i yego zhenshchina' aka 'The President and his Women') delivers a strikingly convincing performance as the mentally unhinged love interest Belogurochka. It is delightful to see a horror film of this calibre (trash horror) trying its hand at some old fashioned Biblical symbolism, as Marina is enticed by the dark side, or Satan's path, as represented by the witches. This is pure Genesis parody, and the tremendous clout of the chromatic imagery is rival, if not commensurate, to that of Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968).

A paradise for the lucky few lottery winners?While one may think this is a rip off on some sub part 70's B flick, I get the feeling this is a segway from Logan's Run, THX 1138 and others. The cast is good, the script is good ... along with the story (important) though some action scenes will stretch (and maybe break?) your belief, these transgressions are minor. All action movies have 'reality' issues.I suppose it is fashionable to bash Micheal Bay. I never really paid attention - but I guess, because of the Pearl Harbor disaster (the film with Ben Afleck, not the actual events from December 7th), people have a deep seated hatred for the director. This hatred is seemingly enhanced by the number of explosions that Bay uses in some of his movies.I think The Island (TI) got a bad rap for product placement. I think this is mostly undeserved. I did think the XBox (live people fighting) was badly placed... it just seemed silly, but other 'placements' seemed very natural - or even funny in a good way. And this leads to the car chase (or one of them). It was much better than the Matrix 2 car chase where all cars seemed to be of a new GM origin and the only cool car was the Camaro (also of GM origin, but at least it had SOME originality). Of course the ads in the movie theater can get annoying ... but that's nothing to do with the movie.I think Bay & Co did a very good job of setting the scene and showing us the human qualities of Jordan and Lincoln. In many ways they seemed more human than the others. Many big questions are raised by this movie and I think many statements are made about the human condition and what people will do to stay alive. How did Lincoln Six Echo develop memories from another person? What kind of influence did the tech/ McCord (played by Steve Buscemi) have on Lincoln. Merrick (Sean Bean) brings up this point, but I think his lack of a real answer makes a bigger statement than anything else.What is real and what is human? What is the nobility of the human spirit ... While these questions are different for everyone I think they are important and should have answers. This movie gives many answers and leaves the right questions.The dialog in TI is good, the actors are good, Scarlet is hot and did well with her role ... I've seen this once and I give it a 9 out of 10.I would go into this movie with as little knowledge about TI, as possible. I would ignore jaded reviewers (professionals who get PAID to review!) who get fussy at the oddest things. I would also ignore the 15 year old retards (is that redundant?) who fail understand that all these ideas are in the public domain and DIRECTORS do not plagiarize (unless they are writers!).

That I still remember several scenes after one viewing thirty years ago, says much more about the impact of the film than it does about my memory.The film is set in the Twin Cities in one of the working class neighborhoods such as existed before the collapse of America's manufacturing culture. Two young friends work in a St. Paul car dealership as mechanics. One is an unmarried wisecracker, the other is more sober and married. The latter's wife is late in her pregnancy and it is the middle of the summer. The summer heat, the boredom of the job and home life, the sense of pinched finances create an atmosphere of a dead end to life in one's late twenties. (One simple shot of the three lead characters sitting on cheap lawn chairs accomplishes so much in advancing this theme.) Through the provocation of the wiseacre friend, the more stable one attempts to rebel against his situation. The outcome of this revolt provides the final theme.The film was shot in the cinema verite, black and white hand-held camera style.

This TV show brings to light the reality of today's disposable relationship and the trials and tribulations that go with pursuing the ultimate in companionship. The series is more or less a series of short stories of a half hour in length each. Each episode shows a very different situation that, while seeming to be the stuff of pure fantasy, is a graphic portrayal of reality in today's sexually curious society. I have seen the first two episodes of this series titled 'Trust Up' and 'Cocktales'. The first episode shows the struggle a young woman deals with when she discovers the man she has met at a local nightclub and spent the night with is actually the same man that her male gay best friend met and has been sleeping with from a gay chat line. This realisation tests her ability to come to terms with the hurt and the internal struggle of her conscience trying to decide whether to tell her friend or not. Eventually she does, however, far from seeming overly upset, her friend keeps coming with reasons and excuses why he should still see this man even though it clearly shows that he is bisexual and not gay and in being so, cannot rule out future experimentation. She tries in vein to convince him that this guy, Callum, is only going to hurt him again and when all else fails goes online, posing as a gay chatter and send a message to her best friend to try and convince him to meet up for sex. He declines saying he has met someone and when he tells her (thinking it is a man) to stick with it as he will find someone soon, she decides to say she has and gives him Callum's handle to indicate that he is screwing around still. This seems to be the final straw for him and he leaves Callum. The episode however finishes with her meeting with Callum for a lunch date and even though he swears to her that he will never do it again, him glancing at their male waiter's backside as he walks away still leaves the door open for his continuing experimentation. The second episode was one that I thought was brilliant. The episode begins in a cocktail bar where people are drinking lavishly and enjoying themselves. Appearing at first that the subtexts of three woman are going to be the basis of the episode, all with very different personality types, and all of whom have agreed to meet this 'Larry', who they have found over a dating website, in this bar, it soon centres on just one of them, a nervous yet beautiful girl sitting at the bar. The twist is that you soon realise that their respective dates is the same man, the barman. As they don't know the one their looking for is the barman, he plays all three woman during the evening until it is certain to him that the one he has been plying with alcohol at the bar all night, played by the absolutely gorgeous Natalie Saleeba, is going to be his best chance of a 'positive' outcome at the end of the evening. Thinking she has been stood up by her date, Larry, she agrees to have a drink with the barman at closing time. After spending an enthralling night of passion in bed with her, she wakes up at his apartment in the morning. After getting up, she sees something that indicates to her that his man may the one she was supposed to meet and that he has been playing her. She discovers this by seeing in the apartment block across the street, a dominatrix walking around scantily clad in her apartment and realises quickly that she is the very same dominatrix that her online beau, 'Larry' has been describing to her in their online fantasy sessions. Viewers, however, cannot be certain that she has made this connection. The rest of the episode plays out with the two of them forming a relationship but with her very cunningly openly continuing her online relationship with 'Larry' which gets up the nose of the barman, even though he is the one she is actually communicating with online. She discusses things online with Larry that the barman does with her in bed, yet the barman can't admit this annoys him as he believes she doesn't know that he is Larry. It ends with her finally agreeing after an argument to end the online relationship and to do some of the sexual things with him that she does online with Larry. Sufficed to say this involves her wearing a dominatrix outfit and with him tied to the bed. The next morning, the barman's flatmate finds him still tied to the bed trying to untie himself with a message written in red lipstick on his chest saying, 'You're half the man Larry will ever be'. A perfect end to this episode that demonstrates that while sexual experimentation seems to be a part of everyday life and is not necessarily wrong, it does not mean that feelings and emotions aren't involved. Overall, a great series and hope there are many more episodes to come.","rw1134160","A real eye-opener - Love Bytes","exxy",1],[["8","10"],"Pizza My Heart (2005 TV Movie)","8","24 July 2005","This movie was not the worst movie of all time.

While I can appreciate many of his films, sometimes I feel he is just too depressing or angst-ridden to watch. This film, in fact, might just be my least favorite film he did--it's a close call between this film and Persona.Hour of the wolf is a very surreal film and I think it was deliberately made to be very confusing as to exactly what was occurring--was Max Von Sydow's character a schizophrenic or were there demons or monsters on this island==it's very hard to tell. Frankly, I found myself not really caring.In addition to MANY confusing story elements, you do get to see an old lady pull off her face and put an eye into a glass of water.

Some of the supporting characters are not defined well either, and there are a few lethargic gaps between events in the tale. The filming on-location is great, and generally it is all rather well made, but it pales against the work that Merchant-Ivory would produce later on, as this simply is not near a perfect film.","rw1134169","My brief review of the film","sol-",0],[["2","3"],"Better Luck Tomorrow (2002)","8","24 July 2005","Better Luck Tomorrow is a teen movie, and it's hard to shake it from that category since it is about teenagers in high school and their adaptation to the society around them. However, in this day of age of corny teen movies where there's nudity a plenty, kegs in every other scene and stereotypical ethnic characters, Better Luck Tomorrow is a refreshing reminder that there are other stories of high school that are much darker than the usual. This movie is one of those stories, and even though it starts out a bit slow, and seems to follow in the beginning all of the stereotypes that we are accustomed to seeing in normal run of the mill teen flicks. This film will surprise plenty of audiences and show a much darker brand of people that we aren't accustomed to seeing in this Post-Columbine Era.The story is a bit simple at first, and seems to be the usual garbage that we see in teen movies everywhere: Shy guy is in love with cute cheerleader girl, but is unable to hook up with her. The first thirty minutes seem to be a bit hard to watch, mainly because it seems like this film will be no different than American Pie, but only with Asian-Americans.However, the movie takes a certain turn when the main character begins to meet more Asians like him, and pretty soon, like a house of cards,everything begins to fall apart and he is brought up in a whirlwind of deceit, greed and even murder. Thus, with elements like these, this film keeps the viewer glued to his or her seat awaiting every twisting turn that is going to happen next. Even though the ending is a bit anti-climatic, making the audience wanting to know what would happen next, it is still a story that is truly original and a breath of fresh air from the usual happy go lucky high school stuff.With the cast being primarily Asian, it was interesting to see how the characters would be depicted. With most teen movies, Asians are stereotyped extremely bad, usually playing roles where the English is butchered and they are computer and library nerds that do nothing but study and watch Japanese Animation. However, the characters are a bit two-sided, which is a great credit to the writers of this film. For at first, the movie seems to follow that stereotype, depicting the Asian kids as nerds who competed in Academic Decathalons and wrote liberalized articles for the school newspaper. But, like the plot of the movie, the characters take turns in terms of personality, and throughout the movie the viewer begins to see the savage personalities and the characters that are really behind the masks of those stereotypes. While the screenwriters deserve credit for these characters, the actors are the real winners, for this unknown cast does a great job depicting these two-faced Asian kids that are half-Honor Roll caliber and half-gangsters. The only familiar face in the movie is Harold from Harold and Kumar, but his role is relatively small compared to the other main actors. While it is hard to remember there names off the top of my head, there performances were extraordinary, filled with subtleness, emotion and anger that is characteristic of good actors. This movie is quite a good stepping stone for these young Asian-Amercian actors, and it will be interesting to see what other movies they will grace in next.It won't be surprising to see many Christian parents hating this movie. The issue of teen violence and drug usage is a very sensitive issue in this day of age, especially after Columbine. However, this is a wonderful movie that is savage and enlightening, for it puts a whole new view on Asian American students in high school, and helps destroy the stereotypes that have accompanied them for years. In its essence, this movie is not about high school kids, but about racism to a certain degree. It shows that stereotypes and premature predilections can not always be accurate, and thus should be avoided in our society today. However, that is a complex message and it requires a true intellectual to pick up on the director's message of racism and stereotypes, but if the audience can't pick up that message, there is still one hell of a movie in Better Luck Tomorrow. For it is a teen movie, but a teen movie that has the grittiness of a pulp indie such as Reservoir Dogs, thus making it enjoyable fare for those who have gotten sick of the usual \"boy meets girl\" comedies and dramas.","rw1134170","A Breath of Fresh Air from the Usual \"Teen Movie\" Norm","objesguy",0],[["2","11"],"Godzilla vs. Hedorah (1971)","1","24 July 2005","This movie was designated the worst Godzilla film in the 50 Worst Movies book and I can easily see why.

However, I watched this movie only a day ago because I am crazy enough to WANT to see all 50 of these \"worst movies\".I really don't want to attack the movie for the costumes--after all, these are guys running around in rubber suits and they are rather expected to be cheesy. But the plot--yuck!! It's supposed to be sort of a pro-environment epic teaching us about the evils of pollution (since the monster grew and thrived on all our garbage and clouds of pollution) but I really doubt if very many people will take that message to heart--they'll just laugh! So what in the plot did I think was the funniest (cheesiest)? Well, I loved how the respected scientist seemed to consult with the annoying little kid (he looked about 7) all the time and the kid seemed to know more about the monster than everyone else! This was funniest when the scientist started talking to him about nuclear radiation and then space travel! Second, when the monster began belching out toxic gasses that choked to death or dissolved the unfortunate people nearby, what do all the teenagers do? Yes, have a giant dance party on Mt. Fuiji!!!

I had the chance to see it on the big screen at a revival screening some months ago (mostly among Joan Crawford fans) on a double bill with Sam Fuller's Forty Guns. Crawford, McCambridge, and definitely Sterling Hayden (one of my all-time favorite 'guy' actors) brought a lot to the entertainment factor of the film. The story goes like this (and if you've seen Sergio Leone's Once Upom a Time in the West, you'll notice obvious similarities, as his was a slight homage of this film)- Crawford owns a bar/parlor on the edge of town. The townspeople want her out to make way for a railroad, most vocally of this is McCambridge (in maybe the best performance of the film, really the most theatrical). The title character is played with usual panache by Hayden, who at first is a little enigmatic, then reveals himself to have a past with Crawford. The story then unravels from there, in a way that actually went against my expectations, much to my delight. This is the kind of genre picture that knows what it is, but with a director clever enough to take chances. For example, there is the contrast of color between Crawford and the angry townspeople near the beginning of the film. She's playing the piano on one side of the room in a white dress, while the others, the supposedly 'good' people of the town, are all in black. Is Ray messing with the convention of good guys white, bad guys black, or do we have to keep attentive all the way through to know how it plays out? I think you'd have to - this is one of those westerns that has enough excitement, humor (mostly dark or unintentional), and a climax that goes with some of the best of them. At the least it should hold up for those expecting something very dated- it's not quite as towering as the Leone films, but on its own terms Ray has a contender against all those old-school Ford/Wayne westerns.","rw1134172","one of my favorite westerns","Quinoa1984",0],[["2","6"],"Mr. Nanny (1993)","3","24 July 2005","I saw this movie years back when it first came out. I was a kid and a wrestling fan at the time, and Hulk Hogan in a movie? You're darned right I'm going! My brother, dad and I went the very first week it opened! Good thing we did, because it didn't last to week two.The movie is basically Hogan as an out of work wrestler. His manager/agent Burt (Sherman Helmsley) can't get him any in ring work because him and Hogan told a promoter they weren't throwing matches. You may say, isn't wrestling scripted like a play? Yeah, but this is 1993. That was still a secret. So anyway, Burt can't put him in the ring so he gets him a job as a body guard for a scientist who just created the chip to some missile or something. Hogan thinks he's golden until he learns that he's not guarding the scientist: he's guarding his kids. The kids are little monsters who have terrorized every nanny they've ever had. Plus one added twist we didn't see coming: HOGAN HATES KIDS!!! So who will have the last laugh, Hogan or the kids? The answer: not the audience.The kids play cruel jokes on Hogan in order to get him to leave. These include short-sheeting his bed, making his exercise bike go really fast and causing him to fall into a pool of red seaweed. I know. The horror. Hogan sticks in there, though, and gets the kids to like him once he spends time with the daughter Kate and teaches the son Alex how to stick up for himself. Of course the son uses his brains, because violence is never the answer. Especially when an ex pro wrestler is on the job.The kids finally fall in love with the Hulkster for good when he punishes them. If God were kind it would be by him giving Alex a big boot and dropping the legdrop on Kate. Sadly, he doesn't even give the \"YOU!!!\" finger. After making them sit on a couch for about an hour, the kids finally respect him and listen. Because their dad never did it and that's why he failed, get it? The movie finally ends when the villain who is trying to steal the chip turns out to be the same wrestling promoter Hogan and Burt told to take a hike years back. That's right: a wrestling promoter turned world-domination villain. Not even Vince Russo could write that piece of gold! The villain, who has a metal skull cap for reasons I don't have the energy to type, is finally vanquished and Hogan isn't needed anymore. But he doesn't leave empty handed. He learns an important lesson about a children's love. Plus he ties Kate's dolly to his motorcycle. And good times are had by all. Except those who have sat through this piece of crapola.I loved this movie when I was a kid. I watched it over and over (haven't watched it since and I still know the whole story).

Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to hold an outrageous, boiling anger throughout the entire film, which is due to her overwhelming passion to become prom queen. However, it becomes completely unknown to the audience why Cherry wants to become prom queen in the first place. Before the nominations are even read off, she storms around the school with a constant disinterest upon being there, and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with. Why does she care so much to be their prom queen? Brooke Balderson apparently presents an \"acclaimed\" performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face, stomping around, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you handed any young actor/actress a script that only requires him/her to act insanely angry, you're not asking for much. You're also not allowing the character to develop very well.Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her character whatsoever. When being harassed by her principal, she knocks him down (after several seconds) with no feelings of disgust or shock or anything equally traumatizing. Her lines are read like she is reading trivia off the back of a cereal box.Throughout the rest of the film, the students in charge of his kidnapping sound more like they are planning a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their principal, sitting tied up in their basement.Meanwhile, Cherry is off killing several female prom queen candidates, and no one even notices or cares. (Yeah, I get it, I get it, the whole town is worried about prom. Very realistic. At least you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops, but that might be asking too much.) For example, right after Cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of students, Beth is found being interviewed by the local media. The reporter mentions \"the shooter\" in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students, but then one second later asks, \"What do you think about guns in the hands of minors?\" or something to that effect. Where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over, with the media showing up again, Beth simply adds that \"she understands (Cherry's) need to be heard\" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unaltered mood. No one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder.Not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town, Julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at her house (Maybe I'm a little left out of the scene, but last time I knew, high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their \"I'm so indie and mod\" attitudes), Beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic.The only compliment I can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful. The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and crisp with each shot.Too bad the acting and script aren't.","rw1134175","This is the kind of movie that makes you ask, \"I wonder what all that money could have been used for instead?\"","sixthirty",1],[["23","25"],"Tokyo Joe (1949)","6","24 July 2005","\"Tokyo Joe\" is rightly called a \"lesser Bogart effort.\" In fact, there is much in this film that obviously derives from earlier Bogart classics, especially \"Casablanca.\" However, this Santana production/Columbia release is by no means without its interesting points. I would point to Alexander Knox's performance in a supporting role, for one. Sessue Hayakawa, as the old fascist surviver, is also good.On the other hand, Florence Marly is pretty weak as the love interest and the plot is somewhat routine. The main plot problem is the Bogart/Marly relationship. There is just too much resemblance to the relationship between Rick and Ilsa in \"Casablanca.\" When you add in Marly's unconvincing performance, the chances of a having a first-rate film are slim. I must also add, reluctantly, that Bogie seems to be walking through this role, much as he did in another Santana film, \"Sirocco\" (1951).That brings me to my final point. Bogart had started Santana Productions in about 1948. \"Knock On Any Door\" was the company's first effort, and it was somewhat popular at the time. \"Tokyo Joe\" was the second Santana production. As a small start-up independent production company, Santana did not have a stable of outstanding actors to call upon. Perhaps that is why they had to make due with a Florence Marly instead of a top female lead to go opposite Bogart.It's also true that \"Chain Lightning,\" 1950, Bogie's next to last Warner Bros. release, wasn't so hot. Maybe the era of the tough but decent Bogart character had simply run its course.I might add here that the third Santana production was \"In a Lonely Place,\" 1950, one of Humphrey Bogart's best, though perhaps most under-appreciated, films.Give \"Tokyo Joe\" a try. It's no world beater, but I have watched it several times, and still find it entertaining.","rw1134176","Bogart action less than outstanding but worth a look.","bill-790",0],[["4","8"],"Would I Lie to You?

The film manages to be both cynical and hopeful in its outlook on love, and straddles a fine line of highbrow and lowbrow humor pretty successfully. Susan Ward, the bad girl with a heart of stone from \"The In Crowd\" makes a 180 degree turn here from her previous tough chick roles, and she is just great as a slightly neurotic, insecure but lovable beauty. I never would have expected this type of character from her, but she's fantastic. Brad Rowe is a charming dweeb, and his character's insecurity works. Samaire Armstrong finally gets a leading role, and it's her best performance ever! She's probably got the most complex role in the film (I won't spoil the surprise), and plays the varying levels of her character to perfection. Jonathan Penner (loved him in \"The Last Supper\" with Cameron Diaz) comes on with a vengeance as a classic dirt bag.

This analytic school of thinking was fathered by Freud and was very popular in the 1940s, though nowadays, most experts would agree that there is a very strong biological component to schizophrenia and few cases are the direct result of poor parenting.

It actually was rather funny that although practically everyone was cheating on their spouses in the film, they never really seemed to get around to having sex. Mostly, they just seemed to go through the motions of wooing and sneaking about instead of any real infidelity.Although a few Hollywood films have similar story elements, this movie stands in sharp contrast to the average American film. The French in the 1930s would probably have seen most Americans in films of the day as uptight and too conventional, while Americans would have been amazed at how fixated the French were on infidelity.

I had heard about how bad this movie was and I went down to the Borders Books & Music and bought it. After having turned it on and shut it off on at least 10 successive occasions, I finally made it to the end tonight. You see, every time I fired it up I thought, \"The rest of it can't possibly be as awful as the part I just watched. They can't possibly insult the viewer's intelligence any more than they have.\" The filmmakers proved me wrong each time.The script was clunky, the photography is badly framed and poorly shot, and much of the film just doesn't make any sense. Also, there isn't a single sequence the conclusion of which you can't see coming from a mile away- come on, of COURSE Johhny's \"side\" was going to win the impromptu football game when he has one hand shackled behind his back- and his girl is the prize! And Johnny Walker strutting down the Main street of his staid, middle-American town dressed like he's on his way to a Gay bar on Cowboy Night?! How ELSE would his straight-laced family react than with shock, indignation and disgust? As to the actors, Uma is lovely, Downey is Downey (and I admit is pretty good in his standard hopped-up sidekick role, especially in the motel scenes,) but Hall seems completely uninterested in what he's doing. He really acts as if he didn't really want to do this film, in spite of the fact that he DID want a vehicle that would break his Brat Pack Geek-in-Chief image. I felt sorry for him. He was really cute, but that was it. His character, Johnny Walker, speaks to a crowd of having embarrassed himself towards the end of the picture. To me, it seemed that Hall delivered those lines with utter conviction, and I'm not surprised. If this were on my resume, I'd deny it. Hall has, of course, gone on to a viable and even admirable career. I guess it's really true that you can't keep a good man down, even if he makes such a potentially suicidal career choice as this film. It's a testament to the man's drive and determination to succeed that he left trash like this far behind him and kept working.Another gripe I have: screenwriters Zacharias and Buhai wrote the original \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" so they ought to have known what would work in a Youth comedy. Apparently they forgot.The two worst aspects of this film, however, were these: first, it was unbelievably boring (and a bad movie that is boring is the worst bad movie of all); secondly, the lampooning of corruption in collegiate football is a viable topic and it could have worked if the script had been decent, the story been told in a logically plotted arc, Bud Smith hadn't directed and Hall had acted like he cared (and not mumbled his lines as if he were auditioning for the first time at a Junior High School's offering of Romeo and Juliet.)

He makes those two minutes worth it, but I spent the ENTIRE DURATION OF THE FILM WAITING FOR HIM TO SHOW UP AGAIN... and he never does.

Eric Dansen, the producer, stated that they rehearsed for three weeks prior to the 12 day shooting schedule, which allowed the actors to know each other and truly let their emotions flow, which is highly evidenced in the final act of the film.On a side note, the movie was shot on a \"prosumer\" grade Canon XL-1 camera, which shows that anyone with $4,000 and a lot of free time and free actors can make a great film.","rw1134201","Good low budget indie film, a tad disturbing though","edcrosay",0],[["2","2"],"976-Lars (2005)","9","22 July 2005","Extremely saturated with perverted, dry (at times wet) humor.

Pollard has created a sure-footed send-up of modern romance and what happens when devotion goes over the edge. Camera-work and settings around Kentucky were beautiful, creating a different spin from the constant romance-in-a-big-town-between-overeducated-professionals genre we all know too well.Story splits its time between David (Gil Bellows of \"Ally McBeal\" & \"Shawshank Redemption\"), a popular (and married) local radio talk-show host and Melody (Jennifer Westfeldt of \"Kissing Jessica Stein\"), an attractive pharmaceutical saleswoman traveling through town to see her boyfriend, Sean (Christian Kane, \"Angel\" & \"Friday Night Lights\"). David meets Melody by chance after she humiliates Sean by turning down his very public marriage proposal. As a friendship develops between the two, we learn than Sean's not going to give up so easily on Melody and that David's perfect life as upstanding pillar of the community may not be what it seems...Pollard deftly moves between romance, satire and unfolding mystery without ever letting his story run low on gas. The storyline is tight and the dialog is witty, funny and crisp. Realistic characters have to work around their warts, which creates a very funny commentary on marriage, dating and romantic obsession. Jennifer Westfeldt is particularly good at making a lot out of her neurotic beauty Melody, and she does look good here. Very nice use of multiple subplots and supporting characters (including \"Mike Hammer\" Stacy Keach and Elizabeth Pena of \"Jacob's Ladder\").

As soon as the shortcut to \"The Parade\" appeared and earnest attempts to portray early 1980's life in Britain were replaced with 'Let's Do It First On TV' storytelling, Brookside lost, no, not it's appeal, but it did lose it's wonderful immediacy and realism. During those first few years it had characters living in different houses who could carry on independent story lines without interacting with their neighbours.

Maciste is quite charismatic, and there are several fun, if silly, set pieces that keep the movie going.I prefer this Maciste film to Cabiria quite a bit. Maciste Alpino is funny, silly and quite well made, definitely improved by the advances in storytelling technique between 1914 and 1916. Maciste is the name of a secondary 'strongman/superman' character from Cabiria. He was so popular he was put into a ton of serials and films starring just his character. At the Breakout of World War I, this film was made to galvanize patriotic enthusiasm for the war. The film starts with Maciste and a company of filmmakers shooting a new Maciste film. Then they realize that war has broken out and they are arrested and sent to a concentration camp. It's not long before Maciste plans an escape and takes the camp with him. He joins up and they move into the mountains. There Maciste tracks down and captures a foreign commander and drags them down the mountain to much humorous effect. Then he leads his entire company over the mountain to rout the enemy. They come down the mountain into the backyard of a mansion where a damsel in distress is in danger of being ravished. Naturally, though Maciste doesn't know of her, Maciste leads the charge through defenses three times their numbers and just manages to save the girl at the last moment. Hurrah for Maciste, the end.It's a pretty good film, slow in some parts but an enjoyable silent film. Maciste's character is quite charismatic to watch, in fact he looks quite a lot like the wrestler The Rock. The plot is thin and makes the whole war seem minor and silly, but it's an enjoyable film and more watchable than Cabiria because the technique is much more sophisticated.","rw1134207","Italian star Maciste is thrown in a concentration camp at the start of World War I.

Being a fan of 70s horror in general, I was a big fan of House of 1000 Corpses when it came out. For all the major bashing it took for its campiness, borrowing from other sources, and pseudo-art house aspirations, I found it to be enjoyable, simple horror that didn't take the genre TOO seriously, without being mean spirited. When I sat down in the theater for The Devil's Rejects, I wasn't really prepared for the genius bit of cinema Rob Zombie created. While the touches of camp humor and over the top violence linger, the film itself was beautiful, multi-layered, and unique.While Corpses set up the deranged Firefly family as a stock group of serial killers, straight out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, TDR refined the characters, making for a movie that was much more realistic. Sheri Moon drops the annoying cackle this time around, in favor of sly deviousness and frantic bloodlust as Baby. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding becomes the villain everyone suspected he was in Corpses, while providing most of the movie's comic relief. But it is Bill Mosely who is the true standout as Otis Driftwood. While the Otis of the previous installment is terrifying at times, many of his mannerisms and lines are derivative of Charles Manson, pushing the boundaries from crazy to just plain funny (the lines about \"scooping ice cream for s**theel friends\" still makes me crack up). This humor is mostly gone from Otis. He is dark, deranged, and murderous, but the love and protection he offers to his \"family\" truly challenged me as a viewer, and awed me to Mosely's subtle and amazing performance. Granted, he still has a few great, hilarious lines, specifically one referencing that OTHER madman in theaters right now, Willy Wonka.Aside from the Firefly clan, the supporting cast is terrific. William Forsythe is powerful and chilling as the sheriff driven by his brother's murder to enact revenge just as grisly as the Fireflys' crimes. The gang from \"Banjo & Sullivan\" are utterly believable and help create some of the film's most haunting moments. Ken Foree is a delight to genre fans who will recognize him as the young cop in the original Dawn of the Dead, here portraying a struggling pimp with ties to Captain Spaulding. Danny Trejo and Diamond Dallas Page provide some truly sleazy moments as the Unholy Two, bounty hunters who are just as amoral as their prey. A truly stellar ensemble cast indeed.Rob Zombie nearly upstages this cast, however, with a script and style as visceral as the grittiest of 70s slasher originals (Last House on the Left, the Hills Have Eyes, and Texas Chainsaw all come to mind). Make no mistake, the Firefly family is vicious, unrepentant, and probably deserve the worst punishments Sheriff Wydell has in mind. They are rapists, killers, and sadists; in short, they are the darkest heart of America, and humanity itself. Why then do we pull for them? Why yearn for their escape? This is what puzzled and confused me, challenged me to think, and in short why I left the Devil's Rejects speechless. While some complained that it was not really scary, I found it truly frightening; that Rob Zombie could give a glimpse into the darkest acts of human depravity and still find some kinship with the perpetrators of such evil scared me. Unlike the over the top killers of House... this Firefly clan has bonds as strong as any family, and scant remnants of redemption beneath layers of evil.Visually, the film is stunning. Stark without being clichéd, Zombie pulls no punches and delivers a haunting vision of the heart of America. While some have complained it is \"not a real horror film,\" Zombie's vision is more frightening than any pilfered Americanized Japanese horrors of the past few years. Cannot come more highly recommended from a fan of the genre. If you're prepared to take a chance and be repulsed and drawn in to a world of depravity, see the Devil's Rejects.","rw1134210","Surprised? Certainly. Astounded?

First off I would not classify this as a horror flick, it was more of a thriller/western/revenge film. The devil's reject group was more subdued this film, less killing, not to dramatic when they killed first lady all the way to the lady running with her husbands face on hers. I mean hell when tiny escapes at the beginning (avoids being captured) you know hes going to do something in the end to help the TDR out. That and the only people I would classify in this film as psychos were otis and the sheriff, they did most of the killing. I have to hand it to the lady who played Mother firefly she was acting like a total nut/psycho and it was great all the way til she got hers really made he character believable. Baby just sucked, no laughing, just acting like a 8 year old most of the time (plus being able to throw that knife through that ladies chest plate, crap!!!). Captian spaulding was pretty much the same character from the first although he seems to have it more together in this film, plus it showed hes not above harpooning whales. Otis was more like a lunitic woodsmen with that beard of his. The sheriff reminded me of some crusader nutjob who was just as violent, but somehow holy. But other than that most of the characters were just to bland to be remembered, too static. Hell I didn't even remember the bands that was killed nor the people killed, or why I should have even cared about what happened to them.Too much of this movie just did not sit well with me, it just wasn't what I was looking for. I would say i liked HOTC more because of the pure violence and satism (I know zombies not a Satan lover, besides that stuffs BS) That and bullcrap \"we got the drop on you\" then messed it all up.Hopefully Mr. Zombie keeps making films he seems like hes caught onto the right track to revived horror moviesl, though next time leave out the god damn 5 min montage at the end.","rw1134213","western/thriller","altrgod",0],[["5","12"],"The Devil's Rejects (2005)","10","23 July 2005","Oh yeah kiddies... this is one sick, twisted, vile and depraved movie..FINALLY!

In a way, Rob Zombie's second film, 'The Devil's Rejects', affected me the same way his music does- it's usually self-indulgent, stylized like it's nobody's business, and at times its fairly entertaining stuff, but you know while you're listening to it there's better material in the genre. His first film, 'House of 1000 Corpses', was below average for my tastes, as he reveled in the fact that he was a writer/director of a horror film by making a Oliver Stone-esquire pastiche of the genre. This time around, he goes for a more conventional narrative, though saying that one must take into account that its in the framework of a raw, un-hinged, demented, exploitation crime film. So, there are some good points about it, if muddled under by the flaws.As with 'Corpses', the film is style over substance, or story- the characters from the last film, the 'Fireflies' (led by Sid Haig, in a cheerfully disturbing performance), are on the lam from Texas troopers, most particularly the vengeful Sheriff (played by William Forsythe, overplayed for good and bad results) who'll stop at nothing to see they pay for their crimes. On the way to hideout among friends (one of which Ken Foree, one of several obvious nods Zombie makes to past exploitation/horror films with cameos and small parts), they continue the carnage. While watching the film though, one isn't as concerned with any real story as much as just the atmosphere, the fiends and victims who populate this late 1970's hillbilly environment Zombie has sprung up.The good parts are these- Zombie shows himself to be fairly adept at writing scathingly (and I mean scathingly like a iron to the face) witty dialog at times, mostly tongue-in-cheek, and has moments of inspired wild-ness in his style. He also has the good knowledge to let his actors go as nuts as possible, which helps at times to heighten the mood. But this leads into the bad sides of the film, one which some won't be bothered by (mostly die-hards I'd figure to exploitation flicks of the 70's) and some may be even more repulsed by than me: the Fireflys are, by Zombie's manipulation, by default the most sympathetic characters of the movie (when compared to the 'evil' police that is, and the innocuous victims). The problem is, despite some attempts to make them charming by some stretch, to get a viewer on the side of the anti-heroes, he doesn't succeed on this level.During parts of the film, including the ending scene (I won't reveal it, but to give an idea of the scene it's done with Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' blaring out), I started to think about another filmmaker who's gone in the realm of the take-no-prisoners, on the side of the outlaws film-making, Quentin Tarantino. He's not a filmmaker immune to criticism, but in the sort of side-world he's created with From Dusk till Dawn and the Kill Bill films (connected by some similar characters) the anti-heroes have a kind of balance with their more sadistic and 'bad' side to get a viewer rooting for them almost. Zombie is so in love with his style of film-making and these people he's created, that he doesn't realize that these aren't very charming people at all (bullies and children almost all the way through), and as the film heads towards a climax, it's hard to really root for anyone. Maybe that's the point, as a satire, but I just didn't get it, and by the big finale on a road in Texas, the whole experience of the film felt a little, well, average when in regards to the other 'shock' films Zombie pays tribute to.In short, the excesses that Zombie went with in 'Corpses' have sort of lingered on in 'Rejects', and while there are some curious and 'cool' bits scattered about (along with a very good classic/souther-rock soundtrack), it becomes a little boring at times too. I'm sure after this film that Zombie may make more movies, better ones perhaps, but with 'Rejects' he has made an uncompromising, violent, torrid, amusing, and ludicrous work here that does everything to call attention to itself...akin to his solo music work. It's the kind of film I can recommend more to some than others.","rw1134216","I got pretty much what I expected- slightly improved film-making from Zombie's first film, but...","Quinoa1984",0],[["6","16"],"Bad News Bears (2005)","8","24 July 2005","Billy Bob Thornton pulled off what no one other then the late Walter matthau could do, and that's play failed baseball player Morris Buttermaker to a bunch of rag tag kids.

The barbs trading back between Amanda and Buttermaker are funny, as THornton has a great screen chemistry with his younger co star. Not suing Kelly Leak in the original, and not having the classic Rudy Stein characters are a few of the drawbacks,as is not using Amhad's hank Arron loving character (this time around Admand's favorite player is Mark McGwire, who the producers decided correctly to make a punchline) but the biggest drawback is Greg Kinnear as the Yankee's coach. Years removed from battling Ben Stiller to pull off the worst performance in the 1998 crapfest Mystery Men, Kinnear is stiff, not believable, and pretty much close to effeminate. kinnear almost pulls the whole movie down by himself with his wooden performance. While no one can even touch the late Vic Morrow's portrayal in 76, Kinnear's performance in terrible, and him being casted in the role is outright unacceptable. Tanner Boyle was thankful toned down from the 1976 classic, and is no longer spoutting racist words. He still manages , however, to be the team's badass with a mouth that would make sailor's blush.

You see ever dollar up on the screen and every shot looks like it was painstakingly produced (which has also been a regular source of ridicule as well as praise). Forget every other film he's made and let's get to this one.Far more intellectual than what you might expect, don't be surprised if your mind does not occasionally start to dwell on debates of morality and what makes a human being, well, a human being. There are harsh criticisms made about our society and our human nature to the point that you will find yourself demonizing most of the human characters and identifying with the pure, selfless and ideal nature of the protagonists. Our heroes are after all, basically children and therefore have an uncorrupted view of right and wrong, and act on those impulses accordingly. There are some very ugly reminders of what man has been capable in the service of his own selfish objectives, and man's capacity to rationalize the persecution or extermination of other humans and animals as either necessary or because the obstacles are less than human in their eyes. We are quite literally even reminded of the horrors of the Holocaust in a harrowing incinerator scene. We further have our our recall stimulated of another recent act of inhumanity when a major character speaks of a their parents part in resisting the warlords victimizing civilians in Africa. All pretty heavy stuff from the guy who directed the BAD BOY movies. Now, make no mistake, this is still Bay spectacle stuff here, but even much of that has the unique feeling of real and tangible. The cities seem functionaland one conceivable in the near future. There is not a lot of incomprehensible techno jargon to bombard you either. Even the chases, clearly inspired by other action films themselves (even Bay references himself here) seem fresh and clever. It's worth the ticket price.

As usual, Fenech waists no time and takes off her top for the aforementioned sun bathing scene, arousing the interest of Giacomo and Marco and objections from Ines.As if all this wasn't confusing enough, the whole family keeps double and triple crossing each other to get into good graces with the Count. There is photographic evidence of adulterous affairs, a kidnap plot is foiled before the ransom note is dry, the blonde girlfriend from the start is suddenly the new maid, and a young cook who only appeared once or twice in the background suddenly moves in to seduce Edwige into a lesbian encounter (implied, not shown). Meanwhile Renato's gay act keeps getting more obnoxious (cringe as he hilariously vacuums Freddy Mercury style).

While few of the ideas posited in this new film are 'new', Bay and screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have done a more than serviceable job of recycling ideas from other movies that arrived D.O.A.'The Island' is of course a remake of 'Parts:The Clonus Horror', one of the most sordid of D-grade Mystery-Science Theater 3000 candidates - 'Coma' made on a budget of $350,000. Straight-to-video? Straight-to-the-SciFi Channel? Not even close. Even Albert Pyun never managed to stink 'em up this bad - though he came close, many a time.But I'm supposed to be talking 'The Island' here, and not 'The Clonus Horror'. The Island' is a good movie, built on a solid script, excellent production values and sound performances delivered by A-list actors. As I sat in the theater watching this movie, I found myself going through a mental checklist, \"'Logan's Run', check. 'The Island of Dr. Moreau', check. 'Brave New World', check. 'Revenge of the Sith', check. There are even shades of 'Total Recall' and 'Gattaca' buried in here, as the film is a dystopia-buried-in-a-futuristic-consumer-fantasy kind of flick. The question remains, though - was this picture brought to fruition by Michael Bay, or just one of the higher-ups at Dreamworks SKG - SKG as in Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen.Ewan MacGregor redeems himself here, for the 6 years he spent trying to imitate Alec Guiness in the woebegone 'Star Wars' prequels. There's a wonderful long moment in the film where we're reminded he was once Scottish - 'Shallow Grave', 'Trainspotting' anyone? And OMG! Scarlett Johansson is actually a fairly attractive woman - I really couldn't tell before, with her abused girlfriend and serfdom turns in 'Lost In Translation' and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. Again, who knew? But the former Director Bay manages to shine through in some areas, with his signature explosions and oddballs in the supporting cast: Steve Buscemi, showing greater range than evidenced before, demeans himself once again, while Ethan 'Neelix' Philips shows up to disgrace himself as a roly-poly balding-on-top Stryker refugee.For shame! Is it possible to have a Michael Bay movie without cartoonish archetypes? Michael Mann got over it - I suggest that Bay get ahold of the manual and further his attempts at meaningful content. There may be something more memorable than 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor' in Bay's future.

She's amazing. And she and Amitabh still do the couple thing well. I can't really decide if he's better with Jaya or Sharmila. He's such a great actor, he can turn it on and off whenever the director says \"action\".The story is about an Indian boy who goes to a party, sees a woman shot, and decides to intervene. Huge mistake. The shooter is the son of the Home Minister, and before the struggle is over the, boy (Amar, son of Vidhya) has been fatally shot himself. He had JUST been properly married by his parents to Jenny, his love who is English. Of course the whole family and all its friends is totally convulsed, including Jenny who has seen her husband snatched away by death on the wedding day itself.Well, the whole rest of the movie is about the struggle of Vidhya to get justice for his dead son. It is narrated by the ghost of Amar (more ghosts, ghosts seem all over the place in Bollywood). The theme of the movie is that when powerful people commit heinous crimes, Justice becomes not only blind but deaf and cold-hearted.There are so many nice performances in this movie, its impossible to remember them all. Sanjay Dutt plays a mechanic who buys the building next to Vidhya's house and does noisy repair work when Vidhya and Sumi are taking an afternoon nap. There is a lot of conflict at first, but eventually they all become best friends. It becomes important to the plot.John Abraham. Man he is GREAT as the faithful and respectful son.

The problem is that Liz Goldwyn inserts herself into the story, and takes it over with her misguided attempts to do striptease, something that she has neither the looks nor the body for.I mean, if you want to strip, it helps if you have actual curves. This woman needed to go on the all-ButterBurger diet for a month. But it's not her anorexic frame that's the problem here. It's her ego-tripping, wrongheaded approach to the subject that torpedoes this project. Despite having one of the Maysles as her cinematographer, she violates all the rules of documentary film-making, and misses the point time and again.The interviews are great, and funny in spite of the filmmaker, who keeps trying to insert her third wave feminist rhetoric into their life stories. Whereas the strippers themselves are very matter-of-fact about their careers, Goldwyn keeps trying to tell them how they \"owned their sexuality.\" When the women tell her about the raincoat crowd masturbating under newspapers while the dancers did their bump-and-grind, her reaction is priceless: \"How dare they!,\" she says, adding, \"That's not what it was about...It was about witticism...Empowerment.\" No, it was about women taking their clothes off and guys wanking to it. As one of the strippers says, \"We were the poor man's brothel.\" If Goldwyn has a problem with guys beating off to strippers, she needn't worry that anyone will be masturbating to the striptease number she performs at the end of the film.Zorita, a stripper who often used a snake in her act, has a lot of the best lines. Goldwyn keeps asking Zorita about her lesbianism. When she asks what use Zorita had for men, the response is classic: \"A hairy chest and a limp joint. Who needs it?\" At another point, when teaching the fan dance to the clueless filmmaker, Zorita tells her, \"You're queer for asses.\" Anyway, there's some worthwhile stuff to be found here, but there could have been so much more if not for the overprivileged and undertalented Goldwyn and her lame, Women's Studies take on classic striptease.Oh yeah -- she also loses points for using David Bowie's \"Oh!

There are the inevitable complications, but in the end, the girl gets her man (or vice versa, depending on one's point of view). The purpose of this movie, however, is to highlight the Stan Kenton Orchestra and the glorious, exciting music of his \"Artistry In Rhythm\" period in the mid-1940s.

Needless to say, watching a very youthful-looking Stan \"The Man\" Kenton himself, dressed in a sharp-looking dark suit and pounding the piano in his inimitable manner is a real pleasure for any Kenton fan and for any lover of jazz, swing and big band music in general.

Devoid of the healthy budgets pumped into his commercial films of 30 years ago, Franco's new shot-on-video productions are fueled not so much by cash and imagination but by poverty and hallucination. Franco no longer worries about such basics as plot or character development, he moves from scene to scene creating one unbelievable moment and then another, not necessarily caring if the plot or story has moved forward, backward, sideways or completely off the wall. It is as though what's on the screen at the moment is all that matters, what came before or what comes next is anybody's guess -- even Franco's.One Shot Productions is not, as many have claimed, a bunch of fans paying for Franco's filmed fantasies. The production company seems to enjoy allowing Senor Franco to pull the cinematic wool over unsuspecting viewers eyes time after time. VAMPIRE JUNCTION, for example, takes an inexplicable mix of characters (cowboys, doctors, acrobatic nudist vampires, a Dracula-wannabee, drunks, etc.) and tosses them all into a tourist trap of an old West ghost town and allows them all to shake up against one another for 90 minutes or so. Who knows what happens or why? Seeing nubile naked vampettes walking backwards on all fours like spiders while chubby old sheriffs are taking pot shots at old Scratch as we listen to the town drunk warbling nonsense while sitting on a hobby horse isn't supposed to make sense to anyone but Jesus Franco. Naturally, Lina Romay, with her prime deep in her rear-view mirror, wanders through the proceedings trying to solve whatever mystery the director has foisted on the story.And it's as though Franco is daring you to try to understand or even try to enjoy anything he puts in front of you.Many people hate Franco's films and some post vapid commentary on the IMDb or in chat rooms or forums about why he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a camera. The director and his producers must laugh at those comments all the way to their respective banks. I don't think Franco is going to be appreciated by his contemporaries or even by the grandchildren of his contemporaries. Jess is so off the map that only his true fans who can read the subliminal threads from film to film can truly enjoy his latter day output. For the rest of us, we can push around the tea leaves and embrace the rare -- but always present -- moment of exhilarated genius and wait for the next Franco film or video that will exasperate us no matter how prepared for it we will be.And, as usual, we'll laugh at the doubters and naysayers, and we'll make believe we understand the canvas Franco is creating for us.","rw1134234","Part of the New Wave of Jesus Franco","pelly",0],[["3","3"],"Peppi en Kokki (1973–1978)",null,"24 July 2005","Even in the seventies Peppi and Kokki were a throwback to an era long gone.

Not surprisingly, thin Kokki was the most athletic, though fat Peppi mastered the art of balancing a chair on the chin. Each week they would try out a new job and Kokki would eventually botch it up (unless there was food involved, then the blame was on Peppi) whether they were firemen, cooks, stagehands, shopkeepers or detectives. All the action was accompanied by a single piano, with the unmistakable sound of Joop Stokkermans tickling the ivory.You see this was shot like a silent movie, except for narration by Prins Tor van Sombrië himself, Will van Selst (and Bob Verstraete before him). It's funny to hear the all knowing narrator speak old fashioned correct KRO Dutch, proving once again how much times have changed. Later on, having exhausted every job imaginable, they would just stay home on their boat Alma and bother a neighbour called Buurman Beer and his wife Madelief every Saturday afternoon.

This movie is nothing less than a display of sheer brilliance to an utmost prestigious level that proves the genius in director Brad Bird (\"The Iron Giant\"). From the perfectly created characters to the witty and humorous dialog involved, \"The Incredibles\" is the ideal film for true fans of the animation and/or comic book genre. It doesn't fail to provide viewers of with a fragment of every genre; incredible animation, action, and even a bit of drama. However, the aspect most evident in \"The Incredibles\" that was frequently credited for the success of its predecessors was the emotional aspect. The thesis on midlife crossroads on personal and professional dilemmas was well presented.Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) seems an average guy who works in an insurance agency, and lives a \"normal\" mediocre life with his wife Helen and three kids: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. But there's more to it, actually. Bob used to be Mr. Incredible, and Helen was Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), two of the world's greatest crime fighters until a series of lawsuits have forced superheroes to adopt civilian identities. But when Bob receives a mysterious call that has him for a top secret assignment, he sees this as an opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again. He accepts the mission but soon discovers that it is a trap of a nemesis from way back, and the whole family eventually has to to join him to fight evil and save the world.What we have here is something that unfortunately becoming quite a rare thing nowadays: an example of a truly brilliant animation. As I have said, not only does it have some of the most phenomenal computer graphics and action sequences ever committed to film, but like all the best movies it also has the heart to support the movie between the adrenaline-pumping moments. The main reason for this is the great characterization. \"The Incredibles\" may contain a little too much of violence that may be better suited for older children than the younger ones. Yet one cannot easily discount the family themes and comic episodes, with characters like superhero-costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird) and Bob's friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) providing ample support. Another is that the film, as is with previous Pixar films, is effective in the use of computer generated images (CGI) which is a major plus for moviegoers. The details in which the animators for the film present are awe-inspiring and breathtaking. The music also pasted itself impeccably with the atmosphere Bird has created for the film. Very retro.It is a demonstration of precision and excellence, created by the brilliance and meticulous mannerisms of the director.

Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for.

This is also the film's only real flaw - although the scenes showing how the Four adapt to their new-found powers and how they relate to each other are enjoyable, too much time is spent on this and not enough on developing the adventure itself. Victor von Doom's transformation to the evil Dr Doom is done fairly well, but Doom himself doesn't really come across as the towering evil genius you expect from the comics. There is none of the egomaniacal posturing or the grand \"Who dares to challenge the magnificence of Doom?\" type lines we've all come to know and love from the comic books.

As to the non-CGI aspects of the film, it's a rather tedious affair with predictable humour and uninspired dialogue. Not even close to the wit and originality of your average Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner cartoon (of course, those were brilliant so I suppose that's an unfair comparison, since no one these days seems able to write with that level of flair or originality). I find when viewing these sorts of films that it helps to imagine what they would be like if the images were all hand-drawn as in the pre-computer days. Would the film still hold your interest?

That being said, this movie seems so forced in its attempts to be everything to everyone that it doesn't achieve any one particular aspect very well. The drama presented between characters is oddly placed when thinking of what kind of care they movie attempts to make you have for them. Basically, the character interaction is stagnant, with some contractually obligated hints at Anakin's angst or whatever, until such time as the obvious crescendo is is reached and signals another stagnant character interaction. There is nothing that makes you care what happens between Anakin and the ex-Queens relationship, save for an excuse to fart out some of the most forced and/or disinterested acting in Hollywood... and that says a lot. Normally that wouldn't directly make a movie abysmally bad if it has action or other redeeming entertainment value (like special effects), but all the pomp in this film cannot save it from the commitment the movie requires you to invest. It's long, long and cheesy. The movies cares little to present Anakins inner turmoil, and if it gives reason for it, it doesn't bother to make it a focal point. If an audience isn't made to care about the characters inner developments, then how are they supposed to care about the cliché twists and turns it attempts to make? If you don't care about the characters, something the original trilogy succeeded in, you aren't going to care when Padame has twins in a minute and spits out both their names in the same breath. What? Why'd she pick those names? Was she looking for the first thing that came to her head? WHy didn't Lucas have enough sense to foreshadow an influence for her name ideas. All this would seem moot if the scene wasn't supposed to be so important in the entire saga. ANakin, as well is presented as a plastic 2 dimensional character, and I say 2 dimensional, because the film tries to fart out a sorry excuse of struggle of good and evil within him which basically consists in him saying the appropriate lines to tell us which side he is leaning on at the moment. Rubbish! And when he converts he is reduced to the one dimensional archetype tattered super-villain we have all seen before. The only relation I had with this film was when Vader gets off his operation table and shouts in the worst and most unconvincing 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO' I have seen in a film since your favorite Ed Wood film, and the reason for this connection is that that is what i was screaming in my head during this entire picture. I wasn't expecting much in the first place. The first two prequels were horrible, with an amusing battle scene at the end of part II, but this film is exactly what Star Wars film shouldn't be - Star Trek parading around as Star Wars.I think, with all sincerity, that Lucas' new Star Wars 'vision' (starting with his hacking the originals with horrible cabaret scenes and needless animations) is the product of a mid-life crisis. It is not his fault that the best STar Wars film wasn't directed by him (Empire Strikes Back), but there is no reason for garbage like this save for lining your pockets with the money of nostalgic Star Wars fans and their kids. And although, i have a fondness for the originals, and i have that nostalgia too, I am glad I didn't get suckered into paying 7 bucks for this trash. I downloaded it off the internet.

There Alberich is the brother of Mime and the (one of the)biggest villain of the story. He takes the gold from the Rhine ladies but curses it if he has to give it to Wotan. Wotan wants to pay Fasolt and Fafner for the building of the Wallhalla with it. They however fight for it and Fafner kills Fasolt and turns into a Dragon to guard the Gold. Wagner changes the story mainly because he was influenced by Schopenhauers Philosophy and his, then new, Socialistic thoughts. Sieglinde and Siegmund are twins and both children from Wotan. Siegfried is Wotans grandson and he is only born because of Wotans greed. He is in need of a hero who can bring the Nibelung treasure (In fact he is only interested in the Ring) back to him. Hagen is indeed Alberichs son in Wagners opera. Wih Wagner, Mime is a bad person who tries to kill Siegfries who then kills him. at the end Brünhilde jumps into the flames, thus ending her life and burning the Wallhalla and the Gods in it. (Götterdämmerung) So there are several parallels between the movie and Wagners operas. Tolkien didn't like Wagner, because of the way he changed the old stories of both the Edda and the Nibelungenlied. But in fact they share the same inspiration. Now, for a movie who most concurrent with Wagner, Tolkien and Peter Jackson, I think it isn't bad at all. The only trouble to me is that, by changing the story in Richard Wagners way it promises a moral dimension which it doesn't bring.","rw1134257","Good Movie but more after Wagner than after the Myth","music_ed_29",0],[["1","2"],"Sin City (2005)","10","25 July 2005","Sin City is the delightful and devilish idea from the mind of imaginative Frank Miller. The remake of the comic is stylish film noir at its best. This sexy movie weaves three stories into one but each story has one thing in common: they're all in Basin City - a place infested with crooked cops, gangs and prostitutes. The first story is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis) - the rogue cop, one man absolutely determined to save a little girl from the hands of a sexual predator. The second is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke), an apeish ex-con wishing to avenge the murder of his beloved Golde. Lastly, the gorgeous Dwight (Clive Owen) - a guy just wanting to look out for his barmaid girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) but ends up in a war between crooked cops and prostitutes, lead by Gail (Rosario Dawson).The performances were outstanding. Mickey Rourke shone as Marv, and Benicio Del Toro plays a great Jackie Boy. Bruce Willis and Clive Owen both put in solid performances for their respective characters. I was surprised at Brittany Murphy's performance, which in my opinion was definitely her best. Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba (Nancy) and Jaime King (Wendy/Golde) all put in sexy performances. The only disappointing performance was by Alexis Bledel (Becky) - I felt her a little flat and one dimensional, but this did not detract from the movie.The best thing about this movie was the bold, stylish and VERY daring cinematography. It is shot in black and white, with splotches of colour every now and again (a red dress, blue eyes, etc.). I wouldn't be surprised if this movie got a few Oscars under its belt for this alone. The movie borders into fantasy, but never quite makes that step, which is a bold move by Rodriguez. The heroes do not wear capes, don't fly or have special powers, but there is something unnatural about them that is never explained.The movie was an accurate representation of the comics, and I believe is a masterpiece of modern popular culture.

I remember watching it with him and remembered some key parts, but almost none of the plot. There's a reason for that: there's no real plot to remember.Here's the basic plot. A life-long Stoogemaniac by the name of Howard F Howard (Stooge fans will get it) is trying to get married to his girlfriend. But the 3 Stooges are taking over his life as he sees their movies wherever he goes. He runs out during the wedding and goes to live on Stooge Alley: where all the Stoogemaniacs live. This is apparently a newly discovered affliction that causes you to whoop and holler while slapping your Stooge friends. The Stooge center comes ala the men in white coats and pick up the Stoogemaniacs. They put them through a deprogramming system to get them off the Stooges, but in the end it fails as the Stoogemaniacs declare their love in a giant free-for-all pie fight. The movie ends with Howard getting married, with his Stooge friends on hand.That's literally the entire plot. Most of it is used as a set up to show clips from 3 or 4 public domain Stooge films. Frankly it would be a lot better and more enjoyable to just watch the films by themselves, as 99% of the stuff in between is unfunny garbage. Plus you wouldn't have to watch the same jokes repeated half a dozen different times in the same movie.The acting sucks, as you would imagine. The only one that might even get a chuckle out of you is Sid Ceasar. But really, what is there to work with? The directing is simple, as it's only needed to set up the next Stooges clip. Two different scenes in two different buildings are shot in the same obviously refurnished room, and the hallway they had on set was used many different times. Probably the most notable things in the movie are the surprise appearances of James Avery (Uncle Phil on Fresh Prince of Bel Air) and Victoria Jackson (SNL). A somewhat skinny James Avery plays an orderly in the institute, and an even skinnier Victoria plays a nurse. She even gets to do one of her famous handstands during the pie fight.Bottom line, this movie is bad. I know hardcore Stooge fans will probably want to see it, but all I can tell you is that it's not worth it.

There are some Ed Wood/Cetin Inanc type low- budget B-movie mistakes in this one as well, yet someone has to point them out, so maybe you should invite some friends over to share this ridiculous experience, or maybe a talk-show host should examine the movie with the help of a studio audience, and in Turkey that was actually done for this movie ;)","rw1134271","Unnecessary Repetition","KanaX",0],[["5","19"],"I Married a Woman (1958)","10","25 July 2005","Diana Dors made me a fan of hers in this movie.

Its his newest film released on DVD and I have very mixed emotions about it. I liked it because the camera effects were cool and the action was good and then I didn't like it. I'll go through the good and the bad below.THE GOOD 2 OK: The fights: YEAH!!! Steven Seagal fights Gary Daniels! Camera shots: The jumpy camera work was a cool feature to the movie.The actors: Steven Segal and Gary Daniels together in a film and they fight each other! Is this a sign that other well known martial arts actors will be in Seagal's future movies? William Hope and Vinny Jones have appearances. The two women were neat.THE BAD 2 WORST: Seagal's talking: He'd change his voice constantly to a light voice and then a deep voice and if that wasn't bad enough he'd change his accent like a southerner then to a cowboy and then back to the regular accent we're all used too. What the heck was up with that?The fights: There was only a couple but they were OK because they weren't long I mean extremely brief! Daniels was no match for Seagal as he got killed by Seagal. The big bodyguard guy was absolutely not even a sparing partner and the fight with him and Seagal! I mean dang it, a guy like that should have lasted longer! Nick Brimble: Was he trying be Jack Palance or thought he was him? Plot: It was confusing as everything just jumped around back and fourth, back and fourth! The color: The color kept on changing and changing! Why? The dialog: Examples: (Gary Daniels: I'm taking over this Submerine now! Steven Seagal: You're just gonna have to kill me I guess...) (Steven Seagal: Let me ask you a question. What kind of damn fool do you think I am? I'm still in prison for doing the same thing you're about to ask me to do again). I thought a lot of the dialog was funny and I laughed at most of it.The camera work: Why was there so much camera effects? It seemed funny because even when someone got killed they didn't fall like they should. Instead it seemed like they skipped a spaces and got to the ground earlier than you'd expect? The opera concert: Hopw the conductor looked up and here and there when guys were getting killed.Surely everything that seemed funny was unintentional? Right? There many other points I could point out but there are too many of them. You may consider this film to be one of those that are so bad is its films. I would only recommend this film to people who like unintentional hilarious moments in films and of course Seagal completest and hardcore fans.Movie Nuttball's NOTE: If you are big Steven Seagal fan like Me then I strongly recommend you to check out these other great movies!

The only movie I can think of that pulled it off is Mr Roberts.And then came Shrek, which uses pages from a bona fide book of fairy tales as toilet paper, shows the hero taking a slime shower and has maggots wriggling into place to create words  and that's only through the opening credits. Yet, after all that, and the candle made of ogre earwax and a donkey urinating out a campfire, it still manages the most poignantly beautiful scene ever committed to film as the hero and heroine contemplate their lives without each other to the accompaniment of Leonard Cohen's haunting Allelujah.Mike Meyers as the title ogre, Eddie Murphy as his talking donkey sidekick, Cameron Diaz as the enchanted princess and John Lithgow as the vertically challenged villain are all brilliant. The script and direction match their efforts. The animation is simply the best ever done (even to the point of replicating the red-point sun reflection off the camera lens as the heroes emerge from a tunnel). Fantasia eat your heart out.And it isn't just that this is the comedic equal of Arsenic and Old Lace and Young Frankenstein. Or that it is to animation what Citizen Kane was to cinematography. Or that, while creating the greatest of all fairy tales, it lampoons every one that came before it along with the Disney machine that put most of them on celluloid. It's greatest strength is that it's as societally important as Mr Smith Goes to Washington or To Kill a Mockingbird. Not all of us, in fact not many of us, grow up to be swans, and there's not a damn thing wrong with being an ugly duck.Shrek is irreverently funny in a way that delights everyone from bratty kids to insensitive old farts. It's scenes that attempt romantic beauty are the equal of any classic Disney fairy tale. It's message is the most important ever delivered by any story: no matter who or what you are, there's a place for you in this world and you have a right to be happy being you.","rw1134278","You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars.","clarkpark",0],[["42","96"],"Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)","10","25 July 2005","Halloween III: The Season of the Witch is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Tom Atkins, Stacy Nelkin, Dan O'Herlihy, Michael Currie, Ralph Strait, Jadeen Barbor, Brad Schacter, Garn Stephens, Nancy Kyes, Jonathan Terry, Al Berry, Wendy Wessberg, Essex Smith, Maidie Norman, and Dick Warlock!

There is no death row in those countries. And the prisoners have minestrone for dinner. There is a lot you can do with minestrone  you can even use it as a weapon and it has a real filmic potential! The story on the cover of this cheap DVD is not what you will see. But there is Lee Van Cleef all right. He is some kind of Mafia Don, and he looks meek, like some kind of a bookkeeper (which he apparently was in real life). For an escape from prison (it's a cinch!) he is given some workman's clothes, a half length blue coat and a blue peaked cap - and suddenly he looks like Lenin, and I mean the true Vladimir Illich on one of those kitschy Socialist Realism paintings. It is hilarious! The resemblance is so striking that it cannot be a coincidence.The story is not good  well, hardly existing, the editing is chaotic, the unrestored print used for the DVD occasionally badly scratched. But some scenes are really well directed, the acting, the set design and the photography are above average. As often in Italian movies of the period: interesting details, messy as a whole. The movie is principally a comedy. Tony Lo Bianco is hilarious as a small time pimp who thinks the Don is god (he plays a mixture of Roberto Benigni and Eric Roberts in Runaway Train). Van Cleef's adversary is played by Jean Rochefort, a great French character actor who more often plays roles in powdered wigs. There are elements of Film Noir, interesting interiors and lighting and a long and very funny car chase. It's the kind of movie that smart guys like Quentin Tarantino learned from, I guess.

It is one of those films film critics can boast about and actually be correct in saying it is \"brilliant...dont miss it\". \"Leaving las Vegas\" is perfect in every single aspect. Finest acting - Cage earns the title of super-star actor in his meticulous performance of a terminal alcoholic. Shue is unprecedented in her role of downtrodden prostitute with a heart of gold, It is extremely disappointing she hasn't continued her acting as much or in as much distinguished roles. Beyond efficient directing by Figgis (also screen-writer) who's journey to super-stardom has arguably been a downward spiral from here. Figgis is one of the handful of directors who not only understands what he is writing but possesses the ability to convey it to others without being lost in translation. Some criticize his shaky, at times, claustrophobic filming but this merely compliments the story in an overall sense. I admire one such as he, who not only selects the films music but plays much of it himself. Another such great director is of course none other than the master Clint Eastwood. If its one thing this film didn't receive is the amount of recognition and acclaim it really deserved. Note only Cage received an academy award which he unequivocally deserved, but then so did Shue and Figgis. It really is the best film this narrator has seen in several decades. One can only hope that Figgis will retain such majesty and greatness in his story-telling and hopefully call back Cage and Shue for lead roles but no one can even consider repeating or even yet over-shadowing this film's beauty.

The photography is superb, and director Ophuls is served excellently by both James Mason and Joan Bennett. However the very linchpin of the story is the ambivalent and complex relationship between the blackmailer and his victim and it's in this area that the movie falters badly. It's handling of the relationship is straightforward, shallow and basically unbelievable. \"The Deep End\" handled this particularly well; it's the very source of the film's power. It also shrewdly updated the protection of a daughter by her mother, from having the love letters she wrote exposed, to a mothers protection of her gay son's videotaped sexual escapades.Still \"Reckless Moment\" remains a worthwhile experience, but misses making the grade of a \"classic\" thanks to an unimaginative, simplistic and shallow screenplay.","rw1134291","The Shallow End","grahamclarke",0],[["2","2"],"National Treasure (2004)","8","25 July 2005","This Film is really breathtakingly good, it is a very creative film with a lot of stunts and surprising plots.It has a very good story and Nicholas Cage really plays his character very good.The things that they have to do to resolve the puzzle, and the inventive it looks, i can only admire it.The film contains all the ingredients that a good film needs.

Don't watch it to be entertained though; what this film sets out to do is show you something unrelentingly grotesque. There is no gloss here, and no hope.Hollywood has a problem. Frequently we see \"powerful movies\" about the world's poorest and most down-and-out people. The problem is that in real life, the lives of the poorest and most-down-and out people are often banal and undramatic. The Hollywood answer is to inject redemption into the script in order to mask the stink of reality. The results is the Space Mountain of movies, a tamed-down roller coaster experience that deliberately pulls the punches to retain a family--or at least, a hopeful--atmosphere. There's nothing wrong with this approach as long as we remember that what we're seeing is a projection. The problem becomes when we start to believe our own myths.Night at the Golden Eagle is a film that shatters some of those myths. These are the lives of people most of us would rather forget, people with no hope, no future, and only shattered dreams to keep them company. It's rightfully disturbing stuff. Anyone looking to be entertained should stay far away, because Night is a film that is guaranteed to leave you feeling dirty.For all that, it never feels exploitive. Night draws you close to the stench of decay but never cheapens it. There are no false redemptions, no heroes charging in to save the day, not even an \"everyman\" to ease us into the proceedings, nor are any of the developments glamorized as they might be in a film by Tarantino and his ilk.This film is not perfect. It is so dank that it is almost overwhelming, and not quite close enough to a documentary to shake the need for plot. However, the sets and costumes are incredible. The acting ranges from fantastic to mediocre but never sinks to the level of a WB horror movie.Another reviewer mentioned \"racist\" content in this film and I am slightly inclined to agree, in that movies of this kind so frequently demonstrate the fall of a young white woman as synonymous with her sleeping with a black or Latino man. This is an example of a theme that might not be as jarring were not a prominent feature in at least 4 films released between 1999 and 2002.

Approximately two decades after the immensely popular Universal monster movies, the British Hammer studio gained their first SF/horror success with The Quatermass Experiment. In all honesty, it was the popularity of this, and only this Nigel Kneale adaptation that all of a sudden indicated that the audience's hunger for morbid tales and horrific effects was insatiable and Hammer cleverly exploited this given one step at the time, by re-telling other famous franchises. They begun with Frankenstein in 1957, but Dracula and The Mummy immediately followed during the next years. Terence Fisher's The Curse of Frankenstein revives the basic classic premise of Mary Shelley's story but adds a whole lot of horrific aspects that would later become the typical trademarks of the great Hammer production company. For example, the morality-lesson that nobody is entitled to play God and create life himself is not exaggeratedly obtruded like in most other Frankenstein adaptations and the creature's make-up is really monstrous for the very first time. Although, admittedly, that's also due to the fact that the original monster make up, worn by the legendary Boris Karloff as we all remember him, was copyright protected and simply not allowed to be imitated. But, most of all, Hammer implemented these and other minor modifications because their interpretation of the horror genre clearly was much more brutal, spectacular and hence more appealing to the new generation of fans. Suffice to say the success was immense and sequels to both the Frankenstein and Dracula franchise were released quickly as well as other, entirely new horror tales. For nearly twenty years, Hammer Studios set the tone of pretty much everything that concerned horror in Europe and their influence is still very noticeable to this day. The Curse of Frankenstein stars the legendary Peter Cushing as the obsessive and dangerously devoted Baron/scientist, a role he will reprise several times and perhaps THE role that made him the horror icon he's still regarded as to this day, more than 10 years past his death. The film opens with images of the degraded Baron sitting in a filthy prison cell and begins to clarify his life-story to a priest. Orphanaged at a young age, the wealthy and intellectually gifted Victor Frankenstein works, together with his mentor Dr. Paul Krempe, in the field of re-animating dead tissue and brain activity. Even though the two quickly reach a medical breakthrough, Frankenstein wants to take his experiments to a higher level and creates entirely new life by composing body parts of deceased persons. Since not every part of his ideal creation is available easy (like, for example, an intelligent brain), Frankenstein turns to murder. When Victor Frankenstein commits his first murder, exclusively to foresee his creation with the intelligent brain of a professor, everything changes. He descends into madness without really realizing it and he's no longer able to see the difference between science and insanity. Driven by blind obsession, Victor ruins the friendship between him and Paul and he totally neglects his loving fiancée Elizabeth. In a desperate attempt to stop his former friend, Paul damages the brain but still Victor is destined to continue his experiments. The man Frankenstein eventually brings to life is an aggressive monster that looks hideous and doesn't even hesitate to attack his creator. One day, the monster escapes and assaults an elderly blind man, forcing Paul and Victor to destroy the ungodly creature forever....or so Paul thinks. When he returns to Frankenstein's castle several weeks later to attend Victor's wedding to Elizabeth, the Baron proudly informs him that the monster got resurrected yet again and now it even obeys simple commands. Nonetheless, the murderous creation escapes again and this time the consequences won't be dismissed so easily... The priest from the intro can't bring Victor any salvation and the movie ends with the once prominent heir of the Frankenstein fortune walking towards the guillotine... I initially stated that this film isn't really Hammer's finest film. Some of their later horrors (notably The Devil Rides Out, Quatermass and the Pit and also some of the sequels to this very film) look more appealing and more properly elaborated. The budget for Curse of Frankenstein, however, was low and this resulted in occasionally tacky special effects and a lack of diversity in settings. The movie is largely filmed on one location  the Baron's laboratory  simply because there was no money for other decors. The limited budget is also clearly noticeable by the absence of a vast Gothic atmosphere and a modest use of color-shades (there were Hammer is specifically knows for their heavy use of colors). Even though not a very spectacular horror film, The Curse of Frankenstein remains a milestone in the genre, with some great suspense and a truly powerful acting performance by Peter Cushing. This film is legendary for yet another entirely different reason, as it also meant the first of many horror collaborations between Cushing and Christopher Lee! Nineteen, to be exact, including masterful genre highlights like The Creeping Flesh, Horror Express and The House that Dripped Blood. Lee's share in this production is very brief (the creature Frankenstein gives life to) but oh-so-memorable, and his make-up effects still look nightmarish nearly half a century later. It's perhaps not the greatest horror movie ever made but real fans of the genre will have to acknowledge that Curse of Frankenstein is a genuine classic that set a lot of later standards.","rw1134305","Cushing creates lifeHammer re-creates the monster-movie!","Coventry",1],[["0","0"],"12 Monkeys (1995)","9","25 July 2005","James Cole(Bruce Willis) lives in an apocalyptic future where disease has taken over the earth and only a very small percentage has survived by living underground.

New Horror tried to find, to create, a new idea of terror closer to the \"human body\", an immanent and \"rational\" idea of terror.In this way George A. Romero's movies, with their political suggestions, are the more revolutionary in their genre and, well, i think that Marins' movies too, in their particular, experimental way, follow and reinvent the horror cinema modern notion born in 60's. In the beginning of this amazing picture Ze Do Caixao, presenting his three stories, says: \"You cannot understand the terror because you are the terror!\".In this statement resides the whole picture: especially the third story, the best one, shows that what scared us are the body's extremes, the \"instincts\" as Ze says.This argument by Marins\\Do Caixao creates a modern notion of horror: filming this Marins checks new extreme forms of the bodies, a new way to be, a way that can be easily confused with sadism or with pure bizarre gory cinematographic entertainment.But Marin's way is really more radical than this kind of simple stuffs.It's an experimental way! Even if all the three stories are led by the same argument - the new notion of terror related by the new new notion of body - only the third one is successful to get the argument in a great complete visual way.Other two stories, especially the first one, are obvious and don't suggest anything new about searching a suitable image for the matter. Anyway, a good, funny too, modern and experimental horror picture.

I mean let's face it people, this movie is basically about nothing! The story doesn't seem to go anywhere as the movie progresses and in the ending the movie becomes more and more ridicules and implausible. The movie is truly lacking in scary moments also because the timing is just plain bad. Not once did this movie become scary or even tense.Still you have to give the movie credit for a few things. The actors are really superb. But why on Earth is the main character played by Lili Taylor, when you have a cast with Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson and even Bruce Dern? Lili Taylor is the least known actress of the cast but yet she plays the main part. Yes, I know she was kind of 'hot' in the '90's but noway near as 'hot' as Zeta-Jones at the time, who had just done \"The Mask of Zorro\" or Liam Neeson who just before this had done \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\" and \"Rob Roy\", \"Michael Collins\" and \"Schindler's List\" a few years before. Bruce Dern and also Virginia Madsen are terribly underused in this movie, I wouldn't describe their roles as anything more than just a cameo appearance.Also something that this movie deserves credit for is the look of it. Director Jan de Bont had always been inspired by Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\", also back in his days as director of cinematography. This is really notable especially in this movie. There is nothing wrong with the fine cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub, who used to be the director of cinematography of many Roland Emmerich movies and Caleb Deschanel who later dropped out due to creative differences. That's mildly put, Jan de Bont basically is a pain to work with for cinematographers because de Bont used to be a cinematographer himself for years. Cinematographer Don Burgess already also had left the set after 'differences' with de Bont during the filming of \"Twister\". The editing however is bad, I can't believe that it was Michael Kahn who worked on this movie!Persons who will be fairly entertained by this movie are the fans of special effects. There are some nicely made effects, which however are not scary and suitable for an horror movie of this type.It's not a completely unwatchable movie but still a weak and un-scary movie that most certainly is not recommendable.

Instead of unravelling his problems and thus living a happy life with his newly wed wife, his problems continue to escalate until one of the characters die towards the end in a brilliantly well-done twist that came as a shock.!!Spoilers!! Kneel Before contains many scenes of shocking perversion that will shock some people. In fact, there's bound to be something here that will shock all viewers. The genital torture imposed on Annie Sprinkle by the Marquis De Sade is hard to watch. Scenes of penis abuse will make any man watching quiver. The forced urine drinking scene forced Annie Sprinkle to quit porn for awhile. The only other scene that made her reconsider her career was the urination and abuse scene in The Devil Inside Her (1976). The sex scenes all take place in a darkened dungeon which adds to the unpleasant atmosphere already provided. Ron Jeremy takes part in the orgy, well before his days of success in mainstream adult films.

Willi born into the cream of Vienna society rose in the rank of the elite Royal Imperial Guard to the point where he became a member of it's officer corps. Always having friends and relatives in high places to clean up after him after he royally screwed things up Willi has no idea of what being responsible was. With Willi's uncle Gen. Von Hertz, C. Aubrey Smith, in charge of the military base that he's stationed at he knew that whatever boners he pulled good old Uncle Hertz would take care of them. One thing Willi didn't expect to happen was to fall in love with someone else, besides himself,and accept the responsibility that goes alone with that.At a party with his officer friends at the Vienna night-spot \"Madam Saguss\" Willi spots this sweet and lovely young lady Laura Taub, Helen Chandler,who's a music teacher. Later Willi sees Laura going upstairs to a room with big spender and notorious whore-mister Herr Schnabel,Jean Hersholt. Suspecting that Schnabel was up to no good Willi goes to see if everything is all right only to hear Laura screaming inside the hotel-room as she fights off Schnabel from trying to force himself on her. Willi puts an end to Herr Schnabel's advances by punching him out. Taking the grateful Laura, who at first didn't trust him, on a night on the town Willi spends the next morning at her apartment having breakfast. After promising to see her again and kissing her good-by Willi innocently leaves a 100 Krone bank note on her dinning room table. Helen ,who fell in love with Willi, by seeing the note after Willi left now feels insulted by what he did in treating her as if she were just a one night stand to him or even worse. With Helen letting Willi have it when he came to see her the next day, about what he did to her, left him both hurt and humiliated since he also fell in love with Helen. Willi's action, by leaving the money, was nothing more that a show of appreciation not a fee for her spending the night with him, which didn't include anything more serious then two or three harmless smooches and getting her a bit tipsy on a couple of glasses of French wine. Helen goes over the deep end by going back to the sleazy Herr Schnabel and becoming the kind of person that she thinks that Willi thought that she was with her drinking gambling and whoring around. Guilt-ridden by what he did to Helen in turning her into a party animal-type, from the sweet and innocent girl that she was, Willi tries to win her back from Schnabel. Challenging to go head to head with Schnabel in a no holds-bar game of Baccarat Willi feels that would win Helen back to him. In the big showdown Schnabel totally wipes out Willi leaving him 14,000 krone's in debt and a broken and destroyed young man. Being too proud to ask his uncle Gen. Von Hertz for the money and facing disgrace as a member of the Royal Imperial Guard Willi has only one option left open to him: a bullet to the head from his own service revolver. Decent ending that doesn't at all cop-out like you would have thought that it would with Willi redeeming himself and getting back, as well as saving her from a life of sin, the women that he loved Helen. Coming to grips with the real world Willi threw away his playboy lifestyle that he lived all his adult life. Like Willi said when he came to see Helen at the end of the film when asked, by the parents of a young boy that Helen was teaching to play the piano, why he didn't have his army uniform on he answered this way: Were both going to a masquerade and I'm going as a human being.","rw1134324","You measure love with a thermometer not with a calender","sol1218",0],[["5","9"],"Robots (2005)","4","22 July 2005","If you love the ever burgeoning list of computer animated flicks, it's worth seeing \"Robots\" just for the superb visual design.

The same elements of the original are mostly intact - a psychotic serial killing family, vaguely satanic sadism, comedy, torture and a lot of blood. What's missing are the ambiguities, the darkness and the outright psychosis which appear in \"House\". And to compensate the audience for the loss of some of the elements which made \"House\" a good film, Zombie throws in sex - the most over-used plot device in cinematic history. Of course, its not just sex, but sexual violence mixed with torture, blood and nightmares.In other words, where 'house' was a dark, campy, creepy murder flick, \"Rejects\" is a light-drenched, raw, fairly (but not entirely) serious murder flick. No problems with the script, the acting, the concept, or even the plot - but, some definite problems with the entertainment value of the film. This just isn't terribly original and drops the idiosyncrasy of \"House\" for a typical Hollywood approach. Rejects starts out with a police raid on the house of a thousand corpses. Most of the family escape through a tunnel in their basement (why the police were unable to find this tunnel is a mystery). The police nab the mother, who plays up the satanic expectations of the police interrogating her and infuriates the sheriff (well played by William Forsythe) into an obsessive, vengeful state (his brother had been murdered by the family years ago). The Fireflies leave a trail of terror and murder in their wake and Forsythe follows it, until he is able to set his trap. I won't go any further with the plot outline because I do not want to write a spoiler, but I do want to elaborate on Forsythe's intense performance. His rage and self-righteous wrath blur the boundaries between cops and criminals quite effectively as the story progresses. If you want to know what I mean, you'll have to see the film.The Firefly family, through most of the film, consist of Otis a lank tall man with long stringy gray hair, Captain Spaulding, an intimidating evil and merciless clown and Baby, Spaulding's daughter, a cute blond particularly fond of torturing her male victims. The characters are more or less consistent with their portrayals in \"House\", but I have to admit, I think Shari Moon Zombie's Baby was very inconsistent from film to film. In \"House\" she is completely and utterly insane and fearless - using her shrill psychotic laughter especially well. In 'Rejects', she screams a lot, does a lot of running-away, and is actually fairly rational compared with her sadistic, torture-loving murderous kin.Finally, I don't think you can really 'get' this film if you haven't seen 'House'. So if you have any reason to want to see it, see \"House\" first. Some of the behavior of the characters will make little sense to you without their back-story.Bottom line: Weakly recommended for horror fans.","rw1134326","Worth Seeing, But Check Out \"House...\" First","mstomaso",0],[["1","3"],"Hustle & Flow (2005)","10","23 July 2005","I really thought this movie was excellent, if not one of the best I've seen this year. Great story, very inspirational to the \"little guy with a big dream\". I've been a fan of Terrance Howard for years and am very happy to see him finally get the spotlight he should have had a long time ago. Why he hasn't is beyond me. He's got the talent in bucketfuls and has a great yet unique look. Before I knew his name, I used to call him the \"really good black guy with the green eyes\" that was in so many films and the occasional music video. Taryn Manning also really helped make this movie for me as the lovable hooker with a sweet heart. One thing I appreciated - that usually drives me nuts - is that you really got to know and CARE about all the characters. You know how they met, why, what their dreams were and you cared to see them achieve it. The entire audience was laughing, gasping or sucking in their breaths during the film and it's just a shame I had to drive so far to see it. It's not playing in any of the theaters around my house...but I'm OK to get in the car for something good. Did it for Layer Cake, too.

At that point, my husband and I were completely immersed in the world that Ghibli once again wonderfully and almost magically created.

I enjoyed House of 1000 Courpses; it had a Texas Chainsaw massacre feel and went back to the classic horror movie clique's that most horror fans truly enjoy. \"The Devil's Rejects\" is by far more violent and scary. Like the commercial said \"They kill without reason\". That's right! The family's back and they're more homicidal than ever! House of 1000 Courpses was a little edited you can tell by Rob's standards, I think he had more freedom with this movie. It is incredibly violent and in no way should be shown to children. I couldn't believe actually that it was only rated R. But I did for some sick reason enjoy it. I'm not sure why, maybe because I was just in a good mood for a gory flick.In this film, Baby and Otis completely torture this family, and I MEAN torture. Sexually, violently, mentally, your body just aches for what happens to them. But I'm not giving spoilers away. Captain Spawlding is back and he's a lot meaner than the first film.

The pictures in the film and the factory were spectacular and mesmerizing. Without even paying attention to the story line it was clear this was a Tim Burton film, truly fantastic. But Like watching a model trying to ponder physics, the beauty is only skin deep. Where was the heart in this movie? The acting, the dialog, the people all fell short of human behavior. Small example: A child spoiled all her life only taunts her father with the resounding demand: \"I want it Daddy.\" Where's the yelling, the screams, has no one EVER SEEN a tantrum?? Additional Example: The parents seemed hardly upset with their children's misfortune.

Before I say anything else, I'll tell you I'm a critical movie watcher. I'm European, prefer European movies as they have far more depth and diversity and I have little respect for the rubbish shoveled out of Hollywood. But I still keep an eye on it. Even among the trash you can find things worth keeping, and this movie definitely qualifies.The story is sobering, at least at first. It doesn't hold it's punches when the human condition (at least in L.A.) is described, and it shows us racism is rampant everywhere. Yes, even in the USA. The quality of this movie lies is the complexity of the emotion that is shown - events and characters are not black and white, if you pardon the pun. Characters are far more rounded that we are used to seeing in Hollywood movies. Still, Crash doesn't manage to keep it's strong points going for the entire duration of the movie. Sentimentalism creeps in, some events you can see from a mile away and the obligatory 'happy' ending cannot be avoided (I don't think you'd consider it a spoiler if I tell you most characters in the movie have received a lesson in life by the end). But what we see in between opening and closing credits is strong enough to make not want to dwell on that too much - it's also strong enough for me not to be naive and think the lessons learned will stick, not with most of them anyway.All in all, it's a rare thing to see a movie of this quality, with this cast, come out of the Hollywood studio's.

However, Ashley Judd's character as Jessica Sheppard makes up for that and the movie's plot and series of events perfectly tie into the overall quality of the movie. I am a big fan of Ashley Judd as it is. I have seen her in Someone Like You, Twisted, Kiss The Girls, High Crimes, and Double Jeopardy, and I loved every single one of them. I don't agree with the reviews that state that Ashley Judd's reputation of starring in movies with this genre is too consistent and therefore boring. I like Ashley in Crime movies. It works for her.This film starts as Jessica Sheppard (Judd) successfully arrests a convict who has a series of murders on his plate. Soon enough vicious and raging murders begin that contain evidence that points to Jessica from all directions. It is very convincing too. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that up until you find out whether or not she is the killer, you will be convinced that she is, and that effect doesn't spoil the surprise either, because there are still reasons for you to doubt it.This is an awesome thriller that deserves much better reviews than it has been receiving.

I was impressed with her performance in Mr Blandings Build His Dream House where she does more than hold her own in her all too short appearances with stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. And I was not disappointed. She really is the solid center of this movie and its true star. She is like some sort of early method actress with a terrific screen presence, and her stile of acting differs remarkably from the more affected ones of her acting colleagues in this movie who come through as real airheads (or, shall we say designer products?) in their imitation of life.Basically I think this is less a movie about race but about Delilah's values  and in this aspect it is an entirely different movie than the remake of 1957. Although beset by a hard and difficult life, Delilah is a balanced person of principle. And she has knowledge, on philosophical as well as practical ways. She accepts her place in society (that is a personal choice, mind you) and aims to make the best out of it. The world of Big Dreams is not hers. Her meeting another women with the daring and the tenaciousness of a dye hard capitalist is, seen in that context, a sort of an accident. This other woman discovers and exploits Delilah's knowledge, first on a small then on a very large scale. Delilah's values lead to commercial success, Delilah's portrait becomes literally a brand (incidentally, a beautiful Art Deco design, not unlike Uncle Ben's). She takes success gracefully, although she does not really care about it. And she knows, there will always be things money can't buy and they most probably will determine your personal happiness. The daughters of the two single mothers seem to symbolize the mean truth, that there are issues that are simply beyond a mother's will and have to be left to godly powers. Delilah's daughter just wants to be an airhead too (that is a personal choice, mind you). She is most happy blending in with the anonymous general crowd of our modern times selling cigars in a store (Fredi Washington's best scene). There's nothing her mother can do about it.MINOR SPOILER AHEAD At the end of the movie, Delilah dies, probably of a broken heart. The world of airheads was too much for that archaic type of good, motherly woman. She leaves a vacuum behind, and people wistfully watch her stylized portrait eternally turning over flickering electric pancakes on the huge billboard on a rooftop. This will forever be a truly modern movie.","rw1134335","The Woman Who Became A Brand","manuel-pestalozzi",1],[["3","6"],"Attack of the Sabertooth (2005 TV Movie)","2","22 July 2005","Spoilers will be in this.

I think there are way too many people living too long with their parents, (possibly including me some day), and those should not get false encouragement. On the other hand \"You already have everything in yourself, you don't need a wizard\" is useful. Also, a confident woman as the protagonist in a movie, which is not a \"love/relationship-movie\", is still a rather rare sight nowadays. But, all in all the characters are way too simple for my taste. While they work well for delivering the primary messages of the movie, there are nearly no hidden, underlying, secondary themes or messages to think about, unless you count quotes such as \"But sometimes people without brains talk a lot! - Yes I guess that is true...\"(When Dorothy meets the scarecrow) . Also, what conclusion is a child supposed to make when it is told good-looking=good, ugly=evil...

Edward Bellingham(Buscemi) has just gotten a package that he ordered....lot 49. His....ahem....friend Andy(Slater) and Andy's friend Lee help him open it and it's a mummy. This is easy to figure out who will live or die, but the end was a surprise. Wraparound: Elizibeth has just cut the vegetable and is almost ready to eat. He convinces her not yet.Story two: Cat from Hell. Let me just say, this is my least favorite of the four stories(including the wraparound). A hit-man, Halsten(Johanssen) is hired by a wheelchaired old man named Drogan(Hickey). Drogan wants Halsten to kill his cat...because he believes that the cat had killed his two sisters and his butler. Halsten soon realizes that this cat is hard to kill. Easily the darkest of the three stories and also the most predictable.Wraparound: Elizibeth is now ready to eat...but it's still 30 minutes until the oven is pre-heated. Timmy tells her one last story.Story 3: Lovers Vow. A struggling artist(Remar) gets a call and goes to a bar. His lawyer(Robert Klein) is there and tells him that he quits. Remar gets drunk and the bartender is going to give him a ride home. When they get out there, a strange creature cuts, then knocks the bartender's head off. Remar swears that if it doesn't kill him, he'll never tell anyone. After clawing him, the creature leaves. He runs to get a cab, but instead runs into a woman(Rae Dawn Chong). He tells her to stay with him, because it's dangerous out. They have sex and soon get married and have two kids. His art career also started to succeed, so his lawyer came back.

Major Davis Bay, Gary Cole,decided one morning to just walk away from in all and start a new life as a civilian. David first got this idea when he met at a Halloween party sweet and adoring Alyson, Karen Sillas. Keeping his background secret from her by telling Alyson that he's in a top secret military outfit was the perfect cover for him. Back at Jackson AFB outside of Austin Tex. David starts to review his life's options with Cindy and the USAF and decides to change his identity by running away from it. David then calls Alyson, who only met him once, and makes a date with her. Before you know it David, now using the name Haywood,is engaged to be married to her.Faking his death in a bicycle accident Dave purposely leave his wife and kids out in the cold and deserts his military obligation to his country.It didn't take long for Dave to find out that civilian life just doesn't appeal to him. It's now too late for Dave to go back to his first wife Cindy and his two boys with him facing the brig and a military court-martial if he comes back to the USAF. Dave takes up the only job that he could do to support him and Alyson and their infant son Chris: using his skills he learned in the Red Berets to rob banks.Based on a true story \"Lies He Told\" has Dave Bay/Haywood living three, not two, different lives. One of a hard working family man one as a ruthless bank robber and yet another one as a dead and highly decorated, by the President of the US and Prime Misnister Of GB, All-American hero. Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. David Bay&husband David Haywood. Davids actions are, even though unforgivable, understandable in the case of his depression over his marriage to Cindy. The pressure of her nagging him got to the point where he just wanted to get lost and away from her and the kids. But he should have sought professional counseling from the US Air Force, which he would have been gladly provided with, instead of choosing the easy way out. Which in the end lead him straight into Levenworth Ferderal Prison. It may have been that the overly macho Dave thought it would have been a bad mark on his career, as well as his ego, to get help for his problems.Karen Sillas as Alyson is the glue that keeps the film together with her at first going along with her new husbands explanation of his frequent disappearances, some for as much as two weeks, as him doing covert action in keeping the country safe from domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reasons for his long absences were the result of him casing out planing and robbing banks. Which was the only way he knew how to earn a living given from what he learned, in subversive actions, all those years in the elite Red Berets.Alyson tracking down Dave's mom Carolyn Bay(Linda Goranson), who he told her was dead since he was a small boy, in Portland she finds out the truth about the double, or triple, life that he's been leading since he married her. This lead to Alyson finding out about his marriage to Linda and the two sons that he had with her as well as his faked death, and now AWOL, from the USAF.

The canceling of Firefly was as big a mistake as canceling Family Guy. Firefly is probably the most original and refreshing Sci-Fi to hit the tube in a long while. It combines, the noiseless tranquility of space with the best collected characters from a Sergio Leone western and mixes them in a cake pan of brilliant dialogue and smart stories. I think most people who watch the show can enjoy and relate to the simplicity of these characters and their mission. All they want to do is work, they want their next job and they want it to go off without any problems. Simple and sweet (of course it wouldn't be good TV if everything went smooth). I love Star Trek very much, but Voyager and Enterprise made me seek out new life and civilization; and that's when I stumbled on this space opera. I am sad to say I've never seen the original broadcasts, but from discussing sci-fi with a lot of common thinking geeks, like myself, many of them mentioned Firefly and it made me find the series on DVD. Firefly is a highly entertaining and educated show, what was nice is that they don't try and explain too much technology or why things are the way they are. Much like the original Star Trek series, the character chemistry is high and the stories are simple, to the point and fun--oh and the fact that the characters all swear in Mandarin is a very nice touch by creator Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel)","rw1134346","I hope Firely comes back to TV","mjdr007",0],[["1","4"],"Kicking & Screaming (2005)","1","25 July 2005","Will Ferrell used to be one of my favourite actors.

I am a massive Will Ferrell fan, I even liked One Night at the Roxbury, but in this movie Will has no comedic support and fails to provide any humour on his own.

When there is transition from Spanish to Portuguese occupation however, the natives are legally treated as slaves and their status as Christians and indeed as human beings is effectively revoked. Robert De Niro plays a ruthless slave trader who becomes a priest after he is overcome by the guilt of his sins. Much of the film simultaneously documents his transition to the faith and these scenes are some of the most powerful in the film. Jeremy Irons plays Father Gabriel, head of the Spanish Jesuit order who is able to help both De Niro and the native Indians. The film also features the very young looking Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn. The Mission received an Oscar for Cinematography and with stunning visuals and a breathtaking display of the jungle it is not hard to see why. Ennio Morricone's score also received an Oscar nomination and various other awards (e.g. Golden Globe and BAFTA). Morricone's score will undoubtedly stand the test of time as one of the most powerful soundtracks to grace the big screen. It is powerful, emotive and poetic and almost warrants viewing the movie alone. Fans of movie soundtracks will not be disappointed. Overall performances are decent with De Niro again stealing the show. The Mission is a good example of De Niro delivering a powerful performance without having to make too much of a song and dance visually. He also illustrates the contrast between an angry and menacing individual in the early part of the movie to one that is more at peace with others in the latter part of the movie suggesting that anyone can achieve redemption. The Mission is quite an engrossing movie that is possibly drawn out for a little too long. The visual and audio feast is enough to warrant a viewing but it somehow feels like it lacks the hall marks of a true classic. Given the subject matter is not the most optimistic or uplifting film but this is necessary to give the film any sense of realism about human history and indeed what is happening today.","rw1134348","An Engrossing Visual Adventure","arahman",1],[["0","0"],"DeGenere (2003)","7","25 July 2005","This movie is very different from many others own-productions all around; actors and actress are real people taken in the hood of friendship and their roles are conformed to the thematics.

It only gets worse from there, because once the Stooges knock out the spies, they prove that they cannot control a submarine properly.There aren't many highlights in this short, but I will state a couple.

(This gag would be redone even later with Shemp Howard and Curly-Joe DeRita as the third Stooges.)

Revenge of the Sith, is, by far, the strongest of the three prequel films Lucas began releasing in 1999.Revenge of the Sith still exhibits many of the weaknesses of his previous two entries: questionable dialog, some occasionally silly scenes and performances that don't always show the actors in their best light. But this is all trivial compared to the good aspects of Revenge of the Sith: engaging action sequences, outstanding visual effects and the most involving dramatic moments featured in a Star Wars film.As the film opens, the Galactic Republic is still in the throes of war with separatists that began at the conclusion of the previous film. We are treated to an breathtaking extended action sequence that features Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) attempting to rescue the Galactic Republic's Chancellor, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), from the clutches of Sith Lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and the robot army leader, General Grevious (voiced by Matthew Woods). After the success of the mission, Anakin is reunited with his secret wife, Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), who reveals she is pregnant with his child. Plagued by dreams of Padme's death during childbirth, Anakin finds himself more and more susceptible Palpatine's insinuations of learning the power available to one from the Dark Side of the Force. When a critical juncture is reached during the war, the Jedi, not trusting Palpatine's motives, decide to seize the Republic from him, with dire results. Palpatine then convinces Anakin to become his apprentice, with the reward being learning a method to save Padme from death, and so he takes the name Darth Vader. Palpatine then sends him on a mission to wipe out the remaining Jedi and bring the war to a close, while Palpatine manipulates the Galactic Senate into becoming the Galactic Empire under his rule.Most of the details of the plot are familiar to anyone who is fan of the original trilogy, so the outcome of the events of this film are hardly a surprise. However, George Lucas imbues the film with a stronger element of drama than any previous entry in the series. There is some powerful, emotional material on display here, intertwining the fates of various characters in a complex web of deceit and betrayal. Especially moving is the plight of Anakin Skywalker. His character is so desperate to keep everyone that he loves that he actually causes the very things he fears by holding on too tight and making questionable choices. More than any character in the Star Wars saga, Anakin is a decidedly tragic figure, and you cannot help but feel a strong sense of pathos for him as the film progresses.Lucas also delves into the nature of a totalitarian regime and how it can spring up, rather unforeseeable, from a strong and virile democracy. For the first time in the Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith also introduces some shades of grey into the conflict between good and evil, where previously everything had been depicted in black and white. The Jedi are presented almost borderline arrogant, sure of their passionless approach to the universe, while the Sith seem to embrace the affections of others. That does not necessarily change the conflict, the Sith are still evil, the Jedi good, but how Anakin perceives the situation is what gives the new nuances some strength.Of course, a Star Wars film wouldn't be a Star Wars film without some serious eye-candy, and Revenge of the Sith delivers in spades. The elaborate opening space battle is impressive, the screen filled to bursting with visual information. There are several digital characters in the film, the most interesting being General Grevious. He is a mix of machine and living being, and he is no less a character than any flesh and blood actor featured in the film. Yoda returns to the digital fold again after first being rendered with ones and zeroes for Episode II, and again he holds up just as well as the puppet of old.We are also treated to several elaborate action set-pieces, the strongest being the climactic lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan. The battle unfolds on the surface of a molten lava planet named Mustafar, and setting is appropriate for Anakin's decent into his own personal hell. The battle on Mustafar is intercut with a similar duel between Yoda and Palpatine in the Galactic Senate chamber, and both hold our attention without fail.If Episode III has a weakness, it's the acting and dialogue. While most of the performers do a serviceable job, at times they falter, struggling with clunky dialogue. That being said, Episode III does feature at least one standout performance, that of Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. Delivering what I think is strongest performance to date in any Star Wars film, McDiarmid shines as Palpatine moves his plans from the background to the forefront. Ewan McGregor brings some levity to the proceedings with his jovial performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but is serious when necessary. Hayden Christensen brings his work up a notch from Episode II with the darker, more serious Anakin. While he is saddled with some of the worst dialogue, he still manages it well.And so, after better than 20 years, the book is finally (theoretically) closed on Star Wars. I, for one, was glad to be there for the ride, and happy to see it go out on a strong note.

When a comedic movie falls into the same category, it is almost impossible to make sport of it  because any frivolity in the review may be misconstrued as comedic quality that the MOVIE possesses. So let me clarify from the outset: This \"comedy\" is not to be laughed at.Who would have thought that Mel Brooks  the genius writer/director behind Blazing Saddles, History Of The World and Young Frankenstein (a successful comedy movie wholly in the vein of this failed one  pun intended)  would be prone to helming a comedy as pitifully appalling as \"Dracula: Dead And Loving It\"? One imagines that Brooks' comic radar is so finely-attuned that he would have seen through the financial and corporate layers of this film's drudgery and simply either abandoned it and cut his losses when he saw that it was not working, or salvaged the potential high points and let the cutting room floor eat the rest.He did neither, which reveals that something is terribly askew in the Brooks universe. No longer is it \"good to be the king\" - Mel Brooks is merely an old man these days, his tastes no longer running congruent with his audience's; his comedy no longer as energetic or as biting as the wit of his youth (which, relatively speaking, was his late-40s anyway).The Brooks gag formulas are definitely still there, but seem lazily inserted as dependable fallback material, rather than inspired stylistic substance. Jokes which I can imagine my 15-year-old self repeating ad nauseam in the schoolyard, now fall flat and wearisome on inured sensibilities.Not only does the film suffer from rehashed and lazy gags, Brooks' direction lacks coherence and is oft-times merely cursory; there are wide shots, reverses and close-ups which serve no purpose, camera blandly flitting from one unnecessary shot to the next, not merely misdirecting our eye, but searching for subject matter to fill the frame judiciously. Many shots seem to be second-unit throwaway footage. Instead of easing back and letting the film's levity wash over me, as should have been the case, all these logistical details kept bugging my senses, detracting from the already-sparse humor.During the cast-and-crew screening for this film, one has to wonder whether there were any genuine laughs or whether the aura of the director's past glories tainted the crew into believing that they had a good comedy on their hands, thereby eliciting perfunctory giggles out of respect for their elders.In this film's adherence to the original Dracula story and noticeable neglect of comedic opportunities, not only did it fail as a good comedy, it becomes barely convincing as an A-List movie. Brooks did not need to re-make \"Dracula\". Yet this seems to be all he did  in a manner inferior to that of droves of dramatic film-makers before him. Mel's strong suit is COMEDY. So why were we subjected to a film about the infamous psychotic blood-drinker, so loosely sprinkled with jokes that they seem incongruous within the context of the morbid tale? Where you would expect punchlines, there are scene-fades; where you would expect a gag, there is exposition of the Dracula legend; where you would expect laugh-out-loud-slapstick, there are strained attempts at re-capturing youthful insouciance from laurels past. And the dance sequence between Dracula and Mina was needless padding. (Makes you wonder what DID make the cutting room floor.) The actors vacillate between parodying Victorian characters and actually *playing* them. Harvey Korman's Dr. Seward can almost be an actual over-actor from one of the REAL Dracula movies, whilst Steven Weber's Jonathan Harker frequently comes across as an exaggerated English nobleman from a Christopher Lee film. Peter MacNichol, though, makes the perfect Renfield  for ANY Dracula film, serious or spoof - and is the only actor who truly nails his role in this blunt-toothed parody. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony are just too damn hot to be funny: all the self-deprecating melodrama in the world is not gonna help, chickie-babes - LOOK AT THOSE RACKS! On paper, Leslie Neilsen's Dracula seemed like a hilarious coup, as did Mel Brooks' Dr. van Helsing, but both seemed to be laboring under the specter of their own reputations as funnymen. Neilsen playing STRAIGHT and being oblivious to his own humor is how he works best, but here he actively went for laughs, which means that even Brooks, as director, did not discern Neilsen's forte - or *did* discern it and chose to make Neilsen play against type anyway  either way, an erroneous decision. And Brooks' van Helsing seemed too self-aware of every mispronunciation he made - for the sake of schoolyard quotes - to be regarded as genuinely hilarious.If Mel Brooks has grown so blind that he cannot see that the comedy boat has left him onshore; if he has become so oblivious to discernment that he actually thinks this film is noteworthy enough to be considered a vital \"comedy\", the movie's subtitle may well be applied to HIM  \"Dead  And Loving It\".(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.thedunmore.com/POFFY-MovieReviews.html)","rw1134355","Frightfully Fangless","dunmore_ego",0],[["7","8"],"La notte dell'alta marea (1977)",null,"22 July 2005","When I saw Twilight of Love (as it was called) on the fantastic Canadian Drive-In Classics my interest was sparked because it had Pam Grier in it. Never hearing of this movie before I set my PVR to watch it later but I check here on IMDb to find out a little background but there was no plot description, reviews or home video release information. I found that all very strange considering the cult following that Grier has and because of that I ended up staying up and watching the entire thing. W/in the first couple of frames it became quite apparent why Twilight of Love hasn't been painstaking restored because the copy that Drive-In Classics was broadcasting @ times looked like someone had driven over it in their drive way (including missing frames); plus there are some things I'm pretty sure would now have heavy copyright on them like the cans of Coke and a hockey game @ the Montreal Forum that had advertisements for KISS hanging all over the place (you know if something has the KISS name on it Gene Simmons has to get paid).As for the plot of it all ~ Richard Butler; while looking for a fresh face to top his \"perfect ass\" advertising campaign spots the very boyish but still occasionally sexy Dyanne and tries to pursue a professional/personal May/December romance (even it is for only one night). Dyanne likes to play a lot of teasing games but Richard being an old man has little tolerance for such bs and becomes more and more irritable until he learns to play the game himself to keep from breaking down in his mid-life crisis. The entire ordeal is mostly scored w/ a melodramatic organ which sets the groan factor fairly high that when Richard (w/ about 10-15 minutes left , still not having gotten Dyanne in the sack and stranded on an island facing possible starvation and dehydration) reflects about his purist of Dyanne and he just \"didn't give a damn anymore\". That's was exactly how I felt: I just didn't give a damn anymore. The casting of Pam Grier (w/ nothing really to do but hang out on the beach in a bikini during her appearance in the 2nd half) does keep Twilight of Love from becoming a complete dog but mostly for Grier completests : if you can find it.","rw1134357","I just don't give a damn anymore","Alexander_Keith",1],[["1","4"],"Silent Assassins (1988)","4","22 July 2005","Silent Assassins must be seen to be believed.

Silent Assassins obviously had zero budget & the fights look a little cheap but they are violent & contain scenes of people having their hands chopped off, being disembowelled, someone is blown up & a brief decapitation with a Samurai sword, while none of this looks particularly impressive it's quite bloody. There is also a torture scene where Dr. London has spikes inserted under his finger nails, ouch! Forget about Linda Blair getting in on the action despite the artwork on the box where she is shown in black holding a large gun, she is purely to add dramatic impact (yeah right!) & some personal angst between the fights. The fights are OK at best, their reasonably choreographed & to their credit they use lots of weaponry like swords, Freddy Krueger type gloves, knives, guns, rocket launchers (that you don't have to reload) & various axes. The filmmakers managed to chuck in a couple of cheap explosions as well. There is a funny bit where Sam glues a mans mouth shut because he was following him & another one when Sam is interviewing a top Government scientist & on his office door it say 'Private No Admittance' written in blue ink on a piece of paper sellotaped to the door!

I studied \"I Spit on Your Grave' as part of a film violence course at university and was subjected to Ebert's disturbing views on rape revenge and movie violence in general. Ebert feels disgusted by this feature, he feels dirty as he leaves the theatre and is depressed by the immense feelings of guilt the images have left him with. Is this not how one should feel having witnessed a rape (fictional or not)? Would he have felt cleaner if Zarchi had fragmented Jennifer's naked body, had used atmospheric music to eroticise the rape scenes and depicted the female character as enjoying herself even just a little bit? In my opinion one should be disgusted and shocked senseless when viewing such material, and in this sense I feel Zarchi has achieved what many others could not. I think it was brave of the director to put such footage out there, even if he lets himself down with the more generic revenge sequences towards the end. Ebert talks about how he thinks that as a viewer we are subjected to the rapists' p.o.v. and goes on to say that this is a major reason he was so offended by the film. However, if Ebert knew anything about p.o.v. he would know that the audience is put into the place of Jennifer, given extreme close ups of the mens' distorted faces as they rape and mutilate her. We follow Jennifer in her journey from New York and most notably we stay with her during her recovery. The perpetrators are depicted as stereotypical and one dimensional, not to mention uneducated and unattractive. Therefore, if Ebert finds that he is relating to the rapists, rather than the intended Jennifer, I think the problem lies in the critic's psyche, not the feature.To top it off, Ebert reminiscences about the loss of the art of feature films, as displayed by the likes of slasher extrodinaire John Carpenter. The opening scene of Halloween then, shot literally through the eyes of faceless killer Michael Myers as he plunges a kitchen knife into the naked breasts of his older sister, is obviously good clean fun in the distorted mind of Roger Ebert.Don't be be put off by the hype surrounding this movie. Yes, watching these rape scenes is an ordeal that will never leave you, but a film about rape shouldn't be inoffensive. To date I have yet to see such a violent, brutal and disturbing depiction of a such a violent, brutal and disturbing crime. In my opinion, sexualized and eroticised versions of violence as seen in Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street are far more harmful and offensive.","rw1134359","A brave take on the rape-revenge tradition","lauriepaurie14",1],[["1","3"],"Batman Begins (2005)","5","22 July 2005","BATMAN BEGINS The title of this film proves to be an interesting choice. It encompasses in two words the full intentions of the film's developers, whose ultimate goal was to revive a potentially lucrative franchise that audiences left for dead years ago. Unfortunately, it also foreshadows an aimless, lackluster narrative that manages a few, fresh breathes during its otherwise mediocre, two-and-a-half hour journey. Ultimately, the film fails to entertain.This failure is most apparent in its attempt to bring the two worlds of its hero together. On the one hand is Bruce Wayne's world, which occupies the daylight hours of society; the other world, of course, is assigned to Batman, who occupies the night. These two identities make up the overall identity of the film's hero, who really deserves the overall name of Batman, as that character is what interests us most.The makers of this film must know this themselves: this is, after all, a Batman film, and this is what the audience expects to see. The film they made, however, does not reflect this knowledge. True, the film spends a sizable amount of its time  and budget  covering the background of everything associated with the Batman mythos, such as how he fights, what inventions he uses, and how he develops his reputation as a caped crusader. Yet through it all, the character of Batman eludes us, even when he is obviously present on-screen.Something is missing from this film, and its lack is sorely felt throughout. Perhaps it's a sense of the majestic, of the truly heroic. For so much time is spent dissecting the various inventions and techniques that Bruce Wayne  not Batman yet, because the cowl is off  plans to employ, that once we see them in action, their use, and the way it all looks, is a matter of course. It is hard to be astounded by the result, because the method has been fully explained.This almost neurotic emphasis on the realism of Batman's kit is strange, especially when one considers that the principal character was conceived of decades ago, well before any of this technology even existed. Somehow, Batman managed to chase down villains, break crime syndicates, and even save the entire globe, without the use the film's high-tech gadgetry that would feel more at home in a James Bond effort.This reliance on contemporary technology is so acute, the actual character of Batman is left ill-defined. Thus, while we can understand how he jumps from a tall building, and floats to one a few stories below, we have no idea what kind of mettle a man has to made of to even consider making that leap. Nor do we know what truly drives him to stay up every night, risking his life in the pursuit of criminals, only to leave them at the mercy of a system that will most likely free them in a short time.A few answers are offered, and these are revenge for the death of his family; a wounded sense of injustice; and some dimes-store psychology about childhood fears. Yet these are only partial answers, and hardly suffice as explanations of Batman's character. Most people experience a sense of injustice at some point in their lives; but what is it about Batman's beliefs that distinguishes him from us, to the extent that he wears a costume, and chases down some of the most dangerous people in the city? Most people understand the concept of revenge; yet what is it about how is Batman's desire for revenge is so intense that he dedicates his entire life to fighting crime? The remaining characters in the film are equally offered half-baked, and hollow. The lower goons and villains Batman encounters in the film are scared witless by the merest hint of his presence, while the major antagonists of the film muster no greater reputation than that of a bully. Once Batman appears on the scene, they lose the tough coolness they exhibited in front of secondary characters, and revert to laughing, cackling crackpots that know little of strategy, and probably couldn't reason through the theft of a single candy bar. Gotham city is only briefly referred to, and even then, our knowledge is limited to that of dark, grimy streets, and a lot of pouring rain.With few likable, genuinely heroic characters, the film offers little purchase for the viewer to grab on to during its long-winded ride. The fact that, during this ride, very little happens, only adds to the sense of ennui. The flashback scene that occupies almost a full hour passes by in a montage of scenes that could have been taken from a mediocre kung fu flick; while the rest of the movie involves a hefty amount of the aforementioned gadgetry, and an ambitious, villainous plot that is introduced in a decidedly clumsy fashion.Perhaps that is a good term to describe the film's overall mood: it is clumsy. The film attempts to be a thoughtful, genre-defining origin story, for a character that has fascinated many for over half a century. In this effort it fails, instead attaining a mediocre status that is entirely due to an earnest cast, and an inflated, Hollywood budget.Does it Entertain? In a word, no. The film is long, and the story uneventful. The narrative is uninspired, and played out by actors who work their hardest, in roles that might as well be straitjackets. The heavy-handed exposition behind every gadget is tiresome, and succeeds only in tarnishing whatever lustre the action might have brought.

This tried to be a comedy and an art film and fell apart at every step of the way. Something can only be funny if the characters have dimension, these were 2D. They represented \"concepts\" not people and that's never funny unless used in a straight satire. If they were going for that maybe they should've removed the romantic backstory and left the film a pure farce on the rich and powerful and those who ONLY aspire to be rich and powerful.The ending was equally unsatisfying... the husband and wife make up and decide to going living the life that made them miserable because it was comfortable? There's no real emotion and as far as I'm concerned a comedic feature without some level of reality is nothing more then a comedy sketch gone mad and allowed to ramble for two hours.","rw1134362","What a stink ball!","redrockman99",1],[["3","7"],"Cole Justice (1989 Video)","9","22 July 2005","I don't know why this movie has received such a bad rap.

The \"action\" scenes consist of a close up shot of, who knows what, with the camera shaking relentlessly. I must give Bay credit however, because it is obvious that he basically made up the whole movie himself as he went along. His visual style is incredible, if only he would stop cutting every millisecond. The cinematography, especially of Scarlett Johannsen is unbelievable. She looks candy-colored. The contrast of the film every time she is shown is amazing, and the natural lighting is a breath of fresh air. We can see shadows on their faces!There is no chance in hell there was ever a full script for this version of the movie. It seems as if Steve Buschemi's lines were the only ones that they bothered to write down on paper and the rest they made up. The pacing of the film is atrocious. Compare this to even the mediocre film \"Minority Report.\" At least that film got the viewer into the story with a great opening sequence. The only decent thing about this film is the pro-life and nature vs. nurture messages it forces you to think about in between boring scenes. Also, the white suits shot from above remind me of sperm, and many of the clones are shown in embryo like sacks, violently being cut upon. Much like abortion. The character \"motivations\" are absolutely laughable. Michael Bay should be ashamed at the way he uses black people in this film. In the extremely unfunny first act, black women and men are used to make \"funny\" sassy sarcastic jokes. After having a black villain, played by Djimon Hundsou chase down the two leads with black helicopters, fire at them with machine guns relentlessly, and lead groups of men in the process of destroying the city of los angeles, he suddenly becomes a \"good\" guy. He turns against his employers and decides to help liberate the clones.There is a character who seems to be an overacting Canadian actor hamming it up. He seems to be comic relief, but we all sat through his scenes stone faced. There is one scene where he enters a gas chamber, and panics. Needless to say, it was the best part of the movie. This character IS the movie. When you see him, you understand the tone and the mental age of the script. I remember being 10 years old. This movie was made for eight year olds.Overall, this film is a perfect example of how Hollywood can throw in a bunch of computer graphics and a horrible script and still wonder why they are losing money.","rw1134364","One of the worst films of the year.","erich2076",1],[["5","10"],"Evil in the Bayou (2003 Video)","1","22 July 2005","It must be nice for someone to have so much money that you can make a completely terrible, poorly made movie, just for vanity's sake.

In some scenes the actors have to turn sideways to move out of the action (not enough room to move around on the super small, cheesy sets).

After her parents force her to have an abortion at the age of thirteen, Aviva runs away and hopes to get pregnant again. What she doesn't know is that the doctor at the clinic slipped-up, and left her sterile.Solondz has never been one to go mainstream, or make \"fun\" movies. His works, such as \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" (which \"Palindromes\" is a kinda/sorta sequel to) are uncomfortable to watch. Why? Because they are more truthful and honest then we expect a movie to be. Solondz shows real-life issues in lower and middle class American families who face the harshest realities, and he pulls no punches. This is not your typical multi-plex fare. Not at all.\"Palindromes\" is about Aviva, cousin of Dawn Wiener from \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\". Dawn has just recently killed herself (no surprise there, really), and a five-year old, and black, Aviva vows to never be like her cousin. Eight years later, Aviva (now white, teenaged, and overweight) has her first sexual encounter and gets pregnant. Her mother (Ellen Barkin, in a truly inspired performance) tells Aviva (still white, but now skinny and with red hair) that she will have to have an abortion. Aviva is devastated, as she longs to be a mother. Following the botched procedure, Aviva runs away and embarks on a transformative journey.You've likely guessed that the transformation here is physical, not spiritual. Aviva changes appearance from chapter to chapter, but the person she is inside never changes. Whether she's a skinny white girl or a massive black woman Aviva is still a lost little girl, adrift in a world she can't understand. All she has to go by are her warped perceptions of love, which lead her to the arms of a pervert who likes to go out and kill abortion doctors in his free time.\"Palindromes\" leans heavily to the side of pro-life. Solondz vilifies abortion clinics and pro-choicers to an almost extreme degree. Here are examples:Aviva's mother refers to an unborn child as being \"like a tumor\". Aviva is shown a dump where aborted fetus' are haphazardly thrown away. The clinic botches the abortion. Aviva's pro-choice family includes an accused child molester.I was rather shocked at first, being a pro-choice person myself, but I can not deny that Solondz has created a powerful indictment of the practice of abortion. I'll never give up the pro-choice platform (everyone has a right to choose, after all), but now I'm not so sure I'd ever personally want an abortion for any of my loved ones.Solondz also shows that unwanted children don't necessarily have to be aborted, and that they can have good lives if adopted or sent to foster homes. When Aviva meets Mama Sunshine, \"mother to all of God's children\", we are shown a household where disabled and sick children can lead happy lives. Mama Sunshine has taken in blind children, crippled children, limbless children, and retarded children, and she gives them all good lives. It makes you wonder if Aviva couldn't have given her child a life like this rather than having to be forced to kill it.At the end of it all \"Palindromes\" ends appropriately. IE: as it began. There is a wonderful scene in which Aviva's (supposedly) perverted relative makes a speech about how no one changes, how life is essentially a palindrome. It makes us wonder if the effort Aviva went through to change things was worth it, when we know where she'll always end up. Or do we? Does life have to be a palindrome? Or is there a way to change that, once and for all?This is the year's boldest, most provocative film. It is fearless in it's search for answers, and it requires the viewer to be fearless if they are to get anything out of watching. Please see this film. And don't be afraid to question yourself afterwards.\"Palindromes\" is not a film with answers to the questions, it's a film with questions about our answers.","rw1134366","2005's Boldest Film","CSM126-1",1],[["2","6"],"Filet Meow (1966)","3","22 July 2005","As a cartoon addicted child of the 1970's, I always valued the Tom & Jerry cartoons as an awful waste of a good Saturday morning. This idea of value was made all the more real when these dreadful cartoons were put up against the animated powerhouse that was 'The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour'. Tom & Jerry looked absolutely sterile by comparison when put up against the likes of Bugs, Daffy, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote? Actually, Tom & Jerry did most of the same things the Looney Toons crew would do when it came to the art of the chase, it's just that Tom & Jerry did their chasing without any hint of humor that the Warner Brothers cartoons had in spades. That may sound a bit harsh to Tom & Jerry fans, but Tom & Jerry don't stack up against any two teamers offered up through the ranks of the Looney Toons.When I happened to find one of Tom & Jerry's cartoons (Filet Meow) tacked onto the end of a movie I had TiVoed off of Turner Classic Movies, I decided to see if Tom & Jerry were really as sterile and dire as I remembered. This was their big chance at redemption. I was no longer a child, so this time around Tom & Jerry would have my undivided attention, Bugs and friends were not competing on another channel, and as luck would have it, it wasn't a Saturday morning.There's no use in explaining the plot line of any cartoon, let alone this one. I think that if you've seen one of these 'chase around the house' episodes, you've seen them all. This episode is really no different, that is until a shark comes into the house via the outside garden hose. It's a cartoon, so you just have to go with it. But for some reason or another, I'm not in the mood to suspend belief to the length required of me. I have watched all 6 minutes of this cartoon and my only thought is that Tom & Jerry have failed me again.

Now all Roger has is his cats....and his ad in the newspaper. Once his ad is answered, he calls Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa-oh it doesn't matter I'm whoever you want me to be-Lawrence. Then...they have phone sex.I'm not sure where you're from or when you were born, but I remember that phone-sex bit was played out by the late '80's. I'm sorry but that was trashy.Soon Roger and the broad hook up and have a whirlwind romance. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas, and then have some kinky sex with Roger's son in the other room. She ties him to the bed and seduces him.Roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a bimbo that loves to sleep around. God forbid women only sleep with one man. Soon enough, strange phone calls begin to occur, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute quickness, and she keeps ranting and raving about her ex-husband who used to beat her. It's funny to see Roger believe her through all this stuff. That's until a frumpy co-worker tells him to go snooping through her belongings like a nosy housewife. He takes her crappy advice and lo and behold, he finds a suitcase crawling with fake ID cards and wigs and guns and a crossbow. He immediately takes the suitcase to the police and has her arrested. Even though all this jazz, he still loves the dumb broad. She tells so much lies, it seems her tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once.Roger goes on with his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela who looks like something off of Gremlins 2. She has a child as well and Roger takes quite a liking to her. But something inside Roger's subconscious keeps him connected to Lisa Rohn (if that's even her real name) and he keeps going back to see her.Now Lisa is the \"ex that won't go away\" as she \"earns\" herself a get out of jail free card and shows up at Roger's doorstep and his son Matt is so busy trying to check her out, he pours juice all over the floor.

It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one. Horrible mistake. The box reads like it would be a really good movie. Well, it starts out like it is going to be this great movie. For about 5 minutes, that is. The movie is about a young woman, Laila, who gets killed trying to save her beau, Jack, from a bull. Laila's dad, Cordobes, is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull, and goes on this hunt to find him. That was the first 5 minutes that is good. What follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever. Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary who gives him a ride. I think Mary is supposed to be a virgin Mary type character. You know, Jesus' mother.

After producing Stuart Gordon's first few films, Yuzna decided to pick up the creative end and began directing with BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR. Since then he has helmed a steady stream of horror titles that all have one thing in common; they are well made and full of outlandish ideas but never really good. His latest ROTTWEILER continues the trend.But ROTTWEILER sets itself apart from the Yuzna canon with its extremely bizarre plotting. Set in the future (the only way to possibly explain a half dog/half machine), the film plods along from point A to point B without much originality (think THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME mixed with THE TERMINATOR). Refuges get caughtbad guy molests womanlovebirds get separatedguy escapes prisonmonster dog chases. But then, at roughly the 40 minute mark, things take a bizarre turn. Our hero Dante is trying to catch fish in a stream when the Rottweiler shows up. The dog then chases the naked Dante down the river and then tackles him off a cliff. Dante escapes and finds refuge with a mother and her young daughter. The mother holds Dante at bay with a shotgun and then proceeds to rape him. All the while the robo-pooch is stalking up to the house. Maybe Yuzna was trying to work in some kind of \"man as beast\" metaphor there? But the weirdness doesn't stop there. After escaping from the dog for the 769th time, Dante is visited by the gory ghost of a former friend who tells Dante that his girlfriend is working as a prostitute in the city. Dante goes there only to find out that his girlfriend has been dead for quite some time. In fact, he was there when she was murdered. According to the flashback, she slept with Naschy to save their hides but jealous Dante was having none of that so he hit the road while Kufard unleashed his pet enforcer on Dante's girl. Dante is only a few steps away when this happens but only reacts after she has been torn to pieces. He beats the dog with a lead pipe which is the impetus for this entire long chase. As Kufard simply puts it, \"You hurt my dog!\"The cast for the film is serviceable. For Euro fans there is the welcome treat of Paul Naschy as the main villain Kufard. It is good to see Naschy in something that wasn't shot over four days (I'm still trying to forget that Fred Olen Ray monstrosity) and, although he is on screen for probably 20 minutes total, he gives the film's most commanding performance. Well, other than Zeus as the titular beast. Lead William Miller, looking like a cross between Owen Wilson and Mitch Hedberg, is pretty bad but you have to cut him some slack when most of his lines are, \"Go to helllllllllllllll!\"In terms of the small but appreciated \"scientifically enhanced dog\" film genre, this one is on the same level as 1993's MAN'S BEST FRIEND but pales in comparison to Earl Owensby's 1982 3-D classic DOGS OF HELL.

The Cinematography is quite good, and exemplifies many earlier examples of Japanese Cinema with their frequent use of nature interlude shots. The film seemed childish at first, in the manner in which the characters were portrayed.But upon reviewing the film again, I noted that it was actually more child-like. There was a mature comedic sense of what a child loves in a film about ninjas and samurai sword fights. I could appreciate the nostalgic sense of the old samurai films that was ably caught. The villains seem comic in many ways, and yet there is more than 1 dimension to the group of them. The use of anachronism in the film was to me particularly funny. I won't provide any spoilers, because they are readily apparent when you encounter them in viewing the film.Anyways, if you want a light movie for Saturday night viewing with the kids, or with friends gathered around a bowl of popcorn, and want a good offbeat romantic adventure film, this is certainly one to try.","rw1134373","Deeper than one might expect","sturmritter",0],[["2","5"],"Mysterious Skin (2004)","10","23 July 2005","Great movie!

Moreover, if at age 8, you see your promiscuous mother having sex, you immediately react by falling in the love with the stud she services.

A good step for Zombie, while switching it up, and possibly losing a couple fans, he has struck a nerve in a genre that needed it, so hopefully this movie goes over well in the Box Office, and Zombie gets some funding for some more gorefests.Too bad Grandpa couldn't be in this one :-( he was pretty funny.","rw1134378","What the genre needed..but....","Zombafyed",1],[["4","9"],"Lung do kei yuen (2005)","4","22 July 2005","I saw this film this evening at the Freer Gallery in Washington, DC, as part of their 10th Annual Made in Hong Kong Festival.

It has action, a story that makes sense, high entertainment and... a babe ;-) More seriously, the story is amazing and the acting is pretty good.Many reviewers say that The Island is actually two movies stuck together - one, an exploration of a pretty dim universe and the second, a totally run of the mill action flick. I must agree with that. The first half is a very well made exercise in imagination and set design. The second part suffers from terminal Michael Bay-ism - way too many car chases, way too many explosions, way too many \"boooms, bangs and wowwwwwwws\".Contrary to many summer movies, The Island does NOT require a major suspension of disbelief: the story really makes sense. I'll try to see other movies written by the same team.The acting is very good. The two principals deliver as well in action scenes than in funny scenes (there are a few :-) Sean Bean plays a variation of his typical bad-guy role but he excels in it. Djimon Hounsou (the other Gladiator :-) is good but he has his ups and lows... Steve Buscemi is, as usual, a genius.The special effects are... too good? Micheal Bay seems to have mastered the art of milking too much money from producers - the car chases scenes are well made and are obviously expensive but they kinda distract from the story line. Personally, i would have removed a good half of them.I didn,t notice any major plot holes, besides the fact that the main characters are pretty indestructible... I wouldn't take life insurance on them, it would be a bad bet...There is a lot of product placement in this movie and, at one point, it gets laughable. Watch for a character to be using MSN Search in 2050... Please... Contrary to Minority Report, the cars of the future are not Japanese, there good ole' Cadillacs - I knew the US car industry would come back on top! ;-) Finally, I may buy the soundtrack...

The guy got killed in a car accident but his \"soul\" was transferred to cyberspace so he can cheerfully go on with his modus operandi of slaughtering everybody who's in Karen Allen's address book. Considering the premise of this film is so ridiculous, you'd expect that the cast -and crew members themselves wouldn't take their jobs very seriously, right? Well hell no! There's absolutely no sense of humor in the script and every 'actor' devotedly produces his/her lines like as if they are part of some eminent Hitchcock production. The overuse of visual, headache-provoking effects is very annoying and also pretty pointless, since no one really knows how a soul floating around in cyberspace must be portrayed. So all they do is showing some wild and colorful images that look like irritating screen-savers. There's no suspense (or what else did you expect) and the gore  although plenty  is not at all convincing. The only element worth mentioning (childish of me as well, I know) is the supportive role of a young and ambitious actress called Shevonne Durkin.

The ironic thing is that for the very few people that are NOT sad sacks, are the ones who are somewhat immoral, and cheating on their wives and what not. Or, when you're drunk, or both. Take a look at the Christmas party at C.C. Baxter's company during Christmas time. Compare it with any other time, where it's deadly serious and quiet. So why is it that the sadder ones have the more worries and the more happy ones seem to fly by without a care in the world? I'm not sure, and I think this is one of the problems leaves up to the viewer, which I think is quite brilliant. Jack Lemmon is, what he always seems to be, and that's brilliant.

This film had me stare at the screen in horror, sitting on the edge of my seat. I must congratulate this film on having had such an excellent effect on me.Eau de la Vie takes us to a world where the gap between rich and poor is huge and - at least in the eyes of the truly decadent elite - a (poor) life isn't worth anything. In a posh restaurant, a group of people is celebrating a young woman's entering their class. She's treated warmly by all of them - or at least that is the first impression. Then it comes to choosing the \"entertainment\" for the evening. The choice is left to the heroine, who knows just as little as the audience what this is supposed to mean. She is to select one person out of a group of four intimidated looking people, a middle-aged man and woman, a young, handsome young man and a little girl. She obviously doesn't know what this is about, but quickly picks the young man. As he is then stripped of his clothes and locked into a glass tank, and as the tank slowly fills with water, it finally becomes clear what the \"entertainment\" is supposed to be: watching a man drown. The heroine's reaction to this situation was quite terrifying for me to watch, since I almost entirely shared her horror. I could not help but feel relieved in the end, but when I came to think about it later, my initial relief couldn't hold. This solution isn't really one, I fear, and if anything, the other characters' reaction in the very end is in fact utterly, utterly disgusting.This film is really disturbing. It's a bitterly evil, dark satire of society. I was told after this film that it's been inspired by the political situation in New Zealand at that time. Not knowing anything about New Zealand, I cannot judge whether this is correct, and how appropriate such a grim view is... but who cares? Sadly, this film is always on topic, addressing issues that still exist, and will exist, in many places all over the world.I recommend this film!","rw1134390","An absolutely scary, gripping little gem","limette",1],[["10","13"],"Belly of the Beast (2003 Video)","5","23 July 2005","I've heard of hackwork, but this is getting silly. Why does this guy still have a career? It's pretty obvious that he has nothing but contempt for his audience. The scenery and photography is great, the supporting actors are fine (especially the exotic female love interest), the plot and the writing are OK (if a little hackneyed); in other words the overall content of the movie is good B movie stuff (with some inspired directorial touches in a lot of places). And into this potentially pleasing and exciting melange comes Steven Seagal, who sleep walks through the entire thing as if he had pressing business elsewhere and spends the entire movie with his inner dial set to 'squinty eyed tough guy' and using one of two expressions -('squinty eyed scowl' and 'eyes slightly widened'). I've watched a lot of movies (even a lot of action and martial arts movies) and I've rarely seen a lazier \"lead\" performance than this. You doubt me? Check out the fight scenes - Seagal used to do nice, snappy Aikido/Aikijutsu style fight choreography, and his gunfight choreography was fast, fluid and visceral. Now he uses a stunt double for any scene involving kicking, leaping, or leg fencing. Now he seems to be pretending to be some kind of Tai Chi master and Hung Gar stylist, with a lot of extraneous wire work to hid the fact that he isn't putting ANY 'oomph' or speed into his motions (no matter how hard the director tries to frame him, he's obviously loafing); in fact, Seagal can hardly be bothered to raise his hands above his head or pick his feet off the floor anymore. And he's gotten really fat - the generous fit of the loose kung-fu GI and the numerous flattering camera angles can't disguise his girth or the way his neck balloons out of the shirt collar to give him wattles and a double chin. Almost anyone other actor with a martial arts background and a 'tough guy' persona could have taken the lead role in this move (Jet Li, Gordon Liu, Donnie Yen, or even Don Wilson or Oliver Grunier) and done a better job. Heck, David Carradine could have pulled this off with aplomb. In fact, this could have been a killer movie with a relative unknown in the part. one that could take some acting direction and was eager to prove himself. But someone somewhere still thinks that Seagal's name can sell a movie, and so he gets to grunt out another performance. There are also some weaknesses to the plot that aren't especially Seagal's fault, but I'll blame him anyway: Of course, he gets the exotic Thai call girl in the end for no apparent reason other than the plot requires it. Seriously, there is literally almost NO transition between the point where they are allies and when they are lovers- it's a couple of lines of dialog and that's it. And Seagal's friend the Buddhist Monk comes out of seclusion to help him rescue his daughter, and is immediately able to leap into demanding physical action after 10 years of asceticism, living on 1200 starch based calories and an average of 4 hours of sleep each day. And Southeast Asia apparently has its own brand of voodoo mind control, because a weird shaman type appears for 10 seconds nears the beginning of the movie, and never shows up again until Seagal's final showdown with the bad guy, and then the shaman starts sticking pins into a voodoo doll to slow Seagal down only to be fought off somehow by the chanting and good vibes of the remaining monks. The whole thing is so badly and transparently handled that it will leave you scratching your head in confusion. The plot element is completely out of place in this kind of movie and makes no sense. (It might work in a 'sword play' style movie). The film makers just threw it in there to make Hopper/Seagal even more of a knee-jerk hero than before - the monks are on his side and fight for him, so he MUST be a HERO, right? I sound as if I hate this movie. I don't. I like almost everything about the movie except Seagal, and even he doesn't suck all that much here. It's just that I can't imagine any actor in a leading role of an action movie who has even a shred of self respect doing this little actual work and expecting his fans to accept it. I have no idea what has happened to Seagal in his private life (and it's none of my business) to turn him into such a total hack with such a threadbare schtick. I can hope that he either shapes up and turns his life around, or that he just finally has enough money saved up that he can retire.","rw1134391","Seagal is just going through the motions, but the movie trappings are good!","lemon_magic",1],[["15","21"],"Nature Unleashed: Volcano (2005 Video)","1","23 July 2005","In short, some American guy goes to a small Italian town to carve his name on a tree where his late wife grew up.Enter a crazy girl who lives in the house that the guy's wife grew up in.

Although it incorporates almost all the standard motifs and story ideas from traditional Hong Kong films, the filmmakers made dozens of choices, both major and minor, that implement these old-time plot devices and visual clichés with a vehemence like few films you've ever seen. From the sheer viciousness and cruelty of the featured weapon ( the Flying Guillotine, which yanks off heads at the neck), to the implacable ruthlessness and seeming unstoppability of the Master (who is a genuinely unsettling and scary guy) to the carefree brutality of the tournament duels, to the ear-splitting Foley and sound effects to the offbeat and ruthless strategies and tactics of the one-armed boxer to kill the killers who are after him...man, you will be talking about this movie to anyone who will listen for years after you see it.Any fan of Hong Kong film making ought to see this film at least once.","rw1134395","Has to be seen to be believed","lemon_magic",1],[["28","31"],"Batman and Robin (1949)","7","23 July 2005","I was fumbling through the DVD section in Wal-Mart, and what do I find?

This serial was made at a time when studios spared all expense in making \"fluff\" to appeal to kids when they went to the movies on Saturday mornings. (Don't scoff, all you baby boomers....cartoon makers of the 1970s did the same thing...with the same bad dialogue and bad acting...witness \"Superfriends\", (which I also liked!), they just did it for Television!) I started watching this serial having never seen it...only saw a little of it in the special features of the 1966 Batman movie DVD. The costume is silly...looks like Bruce Wayne's grandmother sewed it together...Robin's costume isn't much better....there is no Batmobile, (although Batman and Robin do ride around in a Mercury convertible, and even change costumes in it..hmmmm..homo erotica? NAH!!), and no Bat-gadgets, although there is a neat scene where Bruce Wayne uses a device in the Batcave to \"retore\" a burned photo-negative. (I also giggle at all the shadows of flying bats in the cave....but you NEVER see a bat!) What there is is a good story! A super-villain..namely \"The Wizard\", whom the episodes lead you to think is an old, wheelchair bound scientist, who, when he sits in a chair that looks like it was stolen from the state penitentiary's execution room, regains the use ofhis legs...and puts on a black costume, shrouding his entire body, and, using a stolen bit of technology he created, can remotely control all motor vehicles...but not only that, he can make them explode as well, and the pies de resistance....he can make himself INVISIBLE!! He also has the ability to project his image and hypnotize victims with flashing eyes. Truly creepy!!! However, there is a GREAT plot twist at the end to prove who the Wizard REALLY is!

Plympton was one of the writers...wasn't he a friend of Ed's??? There is little emotion portrayed by the actors...everyone says their lines in a manner-of-fact way, however, the story is so good and action so fast-paced, you really don't notice it. What I DID notice and what made me giggle, was that EVERY male performer, except the Wizard so far, wears a Fedora!!! They all look like they were in some old gangster movie!! I originally wrote this review after seeing only 6 of the 15 episodes...it was difficult to turn the DVD player off after the 6th episode...but, I wanted something fun to watch tomorrow!!

It's not possible for me to give this serial 10 out 10 stars, mainly because of the bad acting....however, it certainly earns at least 7!

The truth is this is pseudo-SF written by SF illiterates who can't even do some quick fact checking.The basic premise of the show was that, seeing the Vogon hyperspace bypass construction crew coming (or whatever unspecified fate befell the planet) the Leaders of Mankind shoved hundreds of different cultures from Earth in biospheres on a giant Space Ark and set it off across the Universe looking for a new home. (The words 'Eggs' and 'Basket' immediately spring to mind, but what the hey...) The spheres were sealed off from one another to maintain cultural diversity. But Something Went Wrong! (as it always does) and the ship is now out of control. Three wanderers from one of the spheres finds out the TRUTH and, unable to return to their own agrarian, culture wander the corridors of the ship looking for someone who knows how to steer it.Starlost is Canada's second greatest contribution to crap SF TV (first place goes to William Shatner) and is one of those SF shows where the automatic sliding doors make more noise GBZZZZZZZZshup! - than the ray guns do. pew! The show only ran for 16 episodes before it was taken outside and shot (so this \"movie\" is 12.5% of the whole run) and with stunning dialogue like this (between a silver hot-panted Space Bimbo and Kier Dullea as \"Devon\" trying to hide behind his moustache) you can see why it was put out of its misery:Space Bimbo:You've never tasted food like this before...Devon: I've never seen statues that change before or people who appear and disappear before my eyes before eitherJust try saying that out loud - it is unspeakably bad dialogue, and again in the same scene a few moment later:Space Bimbo: Is the Ark in any immediate danger?Devon: It could be, we just don't know when!Maybe Canadian dictionaries of the 70s defined \"immediate\" differently than we do now but the writing in this thing is awful. Shot on video and using some heroic Colour-separation overlay work. (though they still hadn't figured out not to pan or zoom while using it. From time to time the backgrounds suddenly lurch or follow the actors around.) The music is annoyingly randomly placed Oeeeeoooo! pling! pling! Space Music. And why is it that in bad TV SF like this ALL strangers are instantly dragged before the Head of State? Imagine if that happened in the USA... every time a Texan border guard spotted someone where he shouldn't be it would be \"Take him to the President, now!\" It's cobblers.As originally conceived the three protagonists were a couple who were in (forbidden) 'lurrrve' and the woman's betrothed who was sworn to kill them but was forced by necessity to help them in their quest. None of that back-story from the pilot show was in evidence here and the three wooden heroes just stood in a row and took turns to step forward and deliver their lines before trying to hide behind one another again.Another great moment: Exploring the inner city setting in the first part of the \"movie\" Garth comes across a big red door marked \"Exit Forbidden\", thinks deeply for a moment then says \"Exit Forbidden? I wonder if this could be the way out...\" No Garth, It's a fugging Bubble-Gum Machine! Of course it's the way out! that's what \"Exit\" means!

Unlike the usual mute superhero Jack Carver talks, and has plenty of sarcasm to dish out. But what makes this game stand out from the others is the setting. Most FPS games are either based on real life warfare or grim and gloomy sci fi. A case in point is Doom III, where you get to spend 12 hours wandering around dark corridors. Farcry is set on a series of tropical islands, and it's amazing simply how beautiful it all is, brightly colored and radiant, except that people are shooting at you. Later on you get the dark and scary stuff, but it doesn't take up the entire game.Farcry also mixes very well military combat with monsters. The mercenaries are only slightly predictable, usually when a scene stretches on too and long and they start looping voice commands or actions, and the trigens are downright scary to face off against. This was also I think the first game to introduce a realistic looking water, which now is a requirement for every new game.Playing the game will take up the better part of a week, and that's before you start tinkering. There's a few different rendering modes to use, and Nvidia 68X0 series cards can enable a primitive form of HDR lighting, which makes things substantially different. It may not be obvious at first, but most levels have a few different ways they can be played, whether you prefer stealth, sniping, or up-front and personal combat.

Taking place around the time of the third film, many of the living humans have taken refuge inside a walled city. The city's guardian is an armor plated land moving called \"Dead Reckoning\". Inside the city the people are divided by \"The Haves\" (led by Dennis Hopper who over sees the on goings of the civilians and live inside a giant glass tower) \"The Have nots\" are the people who live outside the tower and make it possible for those inside to maintain the life style they have. The movie follows Riley (Simon Baker) who is one of the scavengers that go out in the night and forage for supplies (food and medicine). Cholo (John Leguizamo) is a scavenger who wants to live in the glass tower. He does whats asked of him and more. When he's denied that privilege, Cholo and his buddies hijack Dead Reckoning and threaten to blow up the tower. Meanwhile Riley just wants to get in a vehicle and leave the city for Canada, But those plans are scrapped when he gets into a fracas whilst trying to save Slack (Asia Argento). Riley, Slack and Riley's friend Charlie are locked up in jail cells. But Cholo is running around in D.R. blackmailing Kaufman for a large sum of money (where's he going to spend it I have no idea). Desperate, Kaufman makes a deal with Riley; bring back D.R. and Cholo and he can leave the city. There's a big problem making matters worse. A zombie nicknamed \"Big Daddy\" is organizing all of the living dead. They want one thing. Destroy the tower and Kaufman. Along the way to the walled city, Big Daddy gathers more and more zombies forming a massive zombie army. Kaufman doesn't trust Riley so he has three soldiers follow him (possibly betray him as well). Riley eventually recaptures Dead Reckoning but him and Cholo realize that the same factors that protect the walled city can also make it a huge mausoleum. Instead of fleeing, Riley and the others make a break for the city as Big Daddy and Company barge through. A bloody massacre ensues. The people inside the Glass Tower are so oblivious to life on the outside living in total denial. Reality comes crash down of them when Big Daddy and his motley crew of undead riff-raff bringing them misery and sorrow. Kaufman makes a run for it with his manservant. Big Daddy singles him out and makes a bee line for him. His manservant ditches Kaufman leaving him to face his maker alone. Cholo also has some payback he wants to give to him personally as well. Riley arrives to the city a sees the mess that the zombies have made. He decides to leave north with Dead Reckoning when he learns that the survivors will pick up the pieces and just have to face the reality that their are far too many zombies out there and in order to survive they're going to have to learn to live with them. Satisfied; Riley, Slack, Charlie and the Dead Reckoning crew head off north in search of a place where there are no zombies and people like Kaufman who are trying to hang on to a society that is as dead as the dinosaurs.Years in the making have finally paid off for George A.. Romero. His return to the mainstream and his first zombie movie in twenty years is well worth the wait. Romero knows how to write a movie and this one is no exception. The gore is real high for a R-Rated movie and the acting is pretty good. I like to see Dennis Hopper poking fun of people like himself. The social commentary is excellent and highly entertaining. That's what I enjoy about his movies. People have unfairly slagged this movie for no apparent reason. I don't know why, they should stick to more mainstream Hollywood fair like the Resident Evil series. I wouldn't mind the \"Dead\" series ending here. Romero should continue with the Zombie films but in a different direction. The man knows how to make this genre work!Highly recommended.","rw1134399","Cinema of George A.

Clooney, Turturro and particularly Nelson make for a fine latter-day version of the Three Stooges, with plenty of good-natured face-pulling and double-taking. The large cast all make the most of their tongue-twisting lines and good IL' boy wardrobes - I especially like Von Bargen as the Archetypal Coen Demon-Fiend, complete with hell-hound and sunglasses at night. The title of the movie comes from the film Joel McCrea wants to make (but never does) in Preston Sturges' brilliant Sullivan's Travels, and some of the characters are based on real people (King is legendary Delta bluesman Robert Johnson, for example). The links with Homer's epic poem are a bit tenuous to say the least - a guy estranged from his wife seeking to win her back, some sirens, a Cyclops (sort of) - and the script sometimes feels like it's a collection of funny episodes strung together rather than a coherent story, but it's so much fun that it doesn't really matter. Director of photography Roger Deakins captures a fabulous sepia-toned look to the rural scenes and there are plenty of wonderful visual touches - my favourite being the moment the flood comes and as everything is submerged a school of Clooney's Dapper Dan haircream tins perform an impromptu little aqua-ballet before our eyes. This is a wonderfully unique toe-tapping comedy.","rw1134400","Musical Mississippi Odyssey Comedy","ShootingShark",1],[["11","15"],"Odd Man Out (1947)","5","24 July 2005","Johnny McQueen, the head of a criminal organisation in a city in Northern Ireland, stages a raid on a mill's payroll. It goes badly wrong, a man is killed and Johnny is wounded. With the police hunting him in force and a reward on his head, Johnny is forced to flee through the city at night, unable to trust anyone.This movie has an interesting amoral dramatic structure - it puts a bad man (a terrorist, robber and killer) in the lead, and then asks you to sympathise with him. It does this by emphasising his altruistic qualities (loyalty, friendship, courage) and his suffering - he literally bleeds to death for almost the whole film, the night is bitterly cold, he's slowly losing his mind and almost everyone is out to get him. The drama comes from the other characters' relationships with him - those who love and admire him (sweetheart Ryan and friend Beatty), those who want to exploit him (informer Delaney, hobo McCormick and artist Newton) and those who don't want to get involved with him (cabbie Tomelty and bartender Hartnell). In the end though, I can't empathise with McQueen no matter how much he suffers (unlike, for example, Alex in A Clockwork Orange, who is much worse), because he's responsible by his own actions for the mess he's in. The \"Organisation\" is of course a nom-de-guerre for the Irish Republican Army (and the unnamed city probably Belfast) but the film doesn't make the mistake of addressing political issues - it's purely a drama, full of compassion and insight into human nature.

The movie itself has a (very well made) depressing, revolting touch; two young men on a slum-like neighborhood of Goiânia, a large city on Brazilian's Mid-West, trying to find a way to get some money, go to a demolished hospital, where they end up finding a strange and heavy lead thing with a small steel container inside. They pick both, and then they head to Devair (Nelson Xavier)'s junk shop. Devair buys the lead thing, but says the steel box is just trash, since there's no use for it... the two \"looters\" then decide to give it to him, after all, there's no use keeping a heavy and useless steel box. A curious Devair decides to check out what is that stuff... he opens the container, and see some tiny stones on it.

It was a real tragedy, specially because it could be avoided by simple means. About 10 people have died (officially, only 4...), and lots are suffering with tumors, cancer, and amputations.

If you're going to release a three hour epic, then more has to happen, or actors have to act better, and scripters have to script better than this.Brad Pitt comes off best of the star cast, and in spite of looking like a nine-year-old Robert Redford at times, shows - for Tinseltown - a lot of subtlety, and carries off the comic angles to the script. He and Jake Weber as the creepy bad guy spark off each other well.Anthony Hopkins does his usual irritating 'slow, slow, quick quick slow' performance, and I got the feeling that they could have shaved a welcome half hour off the running time without his pregnant - er - pauses. And, er... portentous - um - procrastinations. Get on with it, man! Stop mumbling! The script is turgid enough!Clare, the totty, nods her head a lot. A hell of a lot. The face of L'Oreal 2001, I gather. I wonder how they got her to keep her head still long enough for the photos? This film may well have stalled her movie career, but at least she got three hours for her showreel.The supporting cast are pretty good on the whole; Jake Weber makes the ridiculous maguffin about the company takeover almost credible. But the Quince character (Jeffrey Tambor) has no place in a global media empire, even if he did marry the boss's frumpy daughter (a good turn from Marcia Gay Harden). And the character's obviously gay; they could have ramped that up. Even the outrageous Bill-Joe relationship is not commented on by supposedly high-powered executives. Brad's too pretty!The main plot about Death hanging about the old man gives you enough to think about to sustain your interest (kinda Bergman) until the immeasurably tedious and tacky party sequence. Then you stop caring, and begin to wonder about things, like:If he's a media tycoon, where did he get such a terrible band? (They make James Last sound like Guns 'n' Roses)Why does he spend most of his 65th birthday party in his home office when he's just retired - knowing he's going to die? Why are none of the members of the board at his party, when they're all available for a phone conference? Who cares whether overprivileged stuffed shirts live or die anyway?And the big twist: (SPOILER)Right, so Death leaves Brad Pitt's body, and takes Anthony Hopkins anyway. I read you that far. But it's got more holes than a cheese grater. How come Brad - suddenly even goofier - is physically 100%? Didn't the hospital, where the daughter Susan is such a brilliant part-time resident, hear about the accident? So do they never find Bill Parrish's body in the grounds? And do Susan and Joe - who must have to change his name - never resolve how he disappeared off the street and woke up weeks later at her Dad's party? Didn't his family miss him? And how come Death can't tie a tie, but knows enough to wash, shave, and change his boxer shorts regularly?You see, you start to ask these things in the pauses and longeurs of this movie, of which there is an abundance towards the end. Someone has already mentioned the annoyance of watching the angst of the fabulously wealthy. The main problem is the time it takes to get there, and your disbelief is unsuspended about half an hour short. The plot device is strong, but not THAT strong.","rw1134404","It's A Wonderful Life If You're Extremely Rich","joachimokeefe",1],[["2","3"],"The Devil's Rejects (2005)",null,"24 July 2005","From the end of my review of \"House of 1000 Corpses\" a couple years ago: \"When we watch a horror flick, what exactly are we anticipating? Is the one-sided nature of the conflict (overwhelming villain, hapless or helpless victim) part of the appeal for us? Do we \"identify with\" the chaser or the chasee? Should we feel a little ashamed of ourselves afterwards? Or, as Captain Spaulding put it, are these just a bunch of jack-ass questions?\" Apparently not... For his \"not a sequel\" \"The Devil's Rejects\" Rob Zombie eschews his previous \"kitchen sink\" approach to keep his camera mercilessly unblinkingly focused on the depredations (both physical and psychological) performed upon those doomed souls whose path happens to collide with Captain Spaulding and (we're now specifically informed) his kids Otis and Baby. Someone commented that at times this was like watching a \"snuff film\"; there's definitely a kind of \"Here it is take it or leave it\" atmosphere. Some have accused Zombie of \"glorifying\" or at least \"siding with\" the vicious killers but if one looks at what's actually on screen instead of the baggage one brings with one, all he's really doing is showing us what's happening. If we accuse Zombie of \"wallowing in\" the nastiness because he won't cut away from it, maybe he wants to remind us that pain and death really aren't just special effects; a bad deed only ends when the doer stops or is stopped. Maybe we're so used to all the eye-blink editing in movies the last few decades (such as Zombie himself used in \"House\") that we've come to expect cinematic mayhem to have that kind of built-in \"brain cushion.\" Really, there's a lot less violence in \"Rejects\" than in \"House,\" and it's a lot more conventionalmost of the deaths are by gun, a few by knife, one person gets squashed by a truck, which latter I knew was coming since she was standing in the damn road so damn long, so that lessened the impact (on me, not on the character). The most painful thing for me to watch was the woman slapping her mother in the face so that Baby would allow her to use the bathroom; there again, Zombie's point seemed to be to ask just what people are willing to do. Personally I'd p--- my pants before I'd slap my mother to amuse some vermin, but maybe it's different for women. (Yeah, I know the character planned to use the bathroom break to try to escape, but how did she know Baby wouldn't just follow her into the bathroom to watch? That would've been right up Baby's alley.) Zombie's technical proficiency should no longer be in any doubt. I imagine he got the performances he wanted; of the three leads, Sid Haig as Spaulding comes off the best with the character no longer having to perform the clown role except once to scare a young boy (reportedly there's an autobiographical element there for Zombie). Spaulding takes a kind of 1960's approach to life---\"If you can't eat it, drink it, smoke it or s---w it, it's useless.\" We don't learn much more than before about his back-story although he's now called \"Cutter\" several times. Bill Moseley as Otis is oddly subdued under his new beard, a far cry from his previous persona bellowing \"I HOPE YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE\" or \"RUN RABBIT RUN.\" (That line gets borrowed by William Forsythe's bloodlusting sheriff near the end, although how the sheriff would have known to use the line is unclear.) He almost sounds preoccupied as he challenges God to strike him dead etc. Mrs. Sheri Moon Zombie as Baby, praise the powers that be, jettisons that excruciatingly annoying cackle for the most part. All three get to do some actual acting late in the going as the sheriff (seeking revenge for his dead brother, who shows up in his dreams) turns the tables on them, letting them experience horror from the receiving as opposed to the dispensing side. The new Mother Firefly picks up where Karen Black left off re over-the-top histrionics, but she does manage to convey an inner depravity so old that it almost seems a Pavlovian reflex when she waggles her tongue at Forsythe. Forsythe, as usual, owns the screen whenever he's on it. Kudos to personal favorite Danny Trejo and a big scarred lug unknown to me as a couple of bikers for hire, the kind of casual stone-bad-asses for whom the goofy serial-killer types are about as alarming as excrement on their boots. My favorite scene was with Charlie the pimp and his minion (a sadly aging Michael Berryman from \"The Hills Have Eyes\" ) buying a couple of chickens from an enormous redneck concerned lest his merchandise be used for sexual purposes. It's profanely surreally funny with sharply written dialogue, unlike the \"F--- you!\" \"Well, f--- you too!\" etc. we get for much of the running time. ....Those expecting Zombie to use his own music for \"Rejects\" will be disappointed (I admit I was). It's mostly Southern-rock classics that we've heard on the radio a million times. Gee whiz, we even get \"Free Bird\" at the end as the soon-to-be-satanically-rejected ride off to their final lead-filled confrontation with law enforcement who, by the way, need to take a course in how to storm a building containing armed suspects.... If Zombie had to use Lynryd Skynryd at the end, why not \"Gimme Back My Bullets\"? I really could have done without the film critic scene; it was funny but seemed absolutely inserted; okay, Marx Brothers characters' names, we get it, we got it before. I know a lot of real critics haven't been kind to Rob but there must've been some other way to get back at them. I would've rather had the Dr. Satan scene that he reportedly shot but didn't use---maybe Dr. Satan torturing a film critic? ..","rw1134405","Echoes of Otis, \"hope you like what you see...\"","fred-287",0],[["4","5"],"Speed Cross (1980)","6","23 July 2005","You gotta hand it to the Italians. They can find a genre in anything & make movies about them. In the early 1960's they made movies about Gladiators. Then they made Spaghetti Westerns. Then Spy Movies, Gothic Horrors, War Flicks, Giallo Slashers, Crime Trash Epics, Racing Movies, Rampaging Shark thrillers, STAR WARS ripoffs, and then modern horror. What's really neat about the Italians is that scripts & performances really didn't matter, often being reused from movie to movie, just like their stock pool of B movie actors.So what distinguishes individual examples of Italian cult cinema are the people involved: This one happens to be about racing motorcycles and stars Fabio Testi as an undercover cop who infiltrates the closed world of professional motocross racing to solve an old case and settle a personal score, or something to that extent. The movie mixes stock footage of motorcycle races with scenes of off-tack intrigue that when edited together & given a musical score function as a feature length narrative.This film has a lot of almost Gladitorial bike riding with competing riders trying to force each other off the road combined with a political corruption subplot, and may have been inspired by ROLLERBALL with James Caan. Such concerns are irrelevant -- The movie has a familiarity to it that is decidedly Italian in it's proprietary nature. You don't have to see a lot of motocross racing movies to enjoy the show, and as offbeat, obscure macho man entertainments go this one is pretty good, even if it is all pretty silly after all is said & done.\"Relaxingly stupid\", with a fine disco era soundtrack, excellent color photography, a good buddy role for Fabio's sidekick, and another gem of an appearance by my hero, the late Romano Puppo, playing a bare-fisted motocross thug named \"Kurt Schmidbauer\" who works for Mr. Big.

Beating people up: Can you say \"Posthumous Lifetime Achievement Oscar?\" I tell you, give me two hours of this any day and you can keep your Tom Cruise, pointless remakes, juvenile superhero thrillers and movies about whacko candy magnates who creepily resemble Michael Jackson.

I have a few gripes about the movie, but first I want to give my opinion on some of the better points.William Forsythe was awesome as the sheriff. I don't think anyone else could have done better in portraying the inner struggle with vengeance and he was just gruff enough to put froth that image of a hard ass Texas sheriff.Sid Haig of course was decent, although not as good as in HOTC. It seemed like he didn't have as many lines and not near as many sarcastic scathing tongue-lashings like he did in HOTC either. You do get an interesting scene when he wakes up from a dream next to his... um... girlfriend lol.spoilers to follow:OK now what I didn't like. The stupidity in this movie is amazing. First off, you have sheriffs surrounding the house, getting into position and then the Sheriff simply pulls out the megaphone and announces their presence (expecting them to come out with hands up) and of course this leads to a firefight. Pretty lame indeed, not to mention the shoddy \"Knights of the Round Table\" armor that some of the family had on, which was pretty ridiculous; reminded me of the beast thing that chases around Marc Singer in the beastmaster.Anyway, after that, Baby and Otis escape, get a car only to STOP at a hotel to rest!! Otis is listening to the radio, hears their names all over the radio and decides to stop at the local hotel to rest.. umm OK but I would think you would try to get as FAR AS POSSIBLE from that town. But of course Rob Zombie had to have them come upon an old roadshow band and slaughter them (which also didn't have much creativity).Then you have the Sheriff (after he ties up and beats the hell out of Spaulding and Otis with a tazer/cattle prod type deal and stapler lol) light the house on fire after he douses it with gas, goes outside for at least 10 minutes, yet Otis and Spaulding get SAVED by Tiny who is at best a ripoff of freddy krueger on steroids.I was about to seriously take off a couple points for the ending, as the movie roars into Freebird by Skynard and you are lead to believe that the torrent trio got away scott-free only to meander on a road block with the rest of the sheriff's department. Luckily, for realism's sake they ARE NOT able to drive right through guys with 20 shotguns this time (Should have packed Galahad's armor) The music didn't do it for me either.

It follows the adventures of a nameless average joe as he is tortured by a 'voice' that torments him endlessly.I liked the concept; somebody tormented by a voice and driven to such lengths that he basically mutilates himself, and as the violence gets more and more horrific, as does the humour, in a Peter Jackson 'Bad Taste' sort of way, but I felt that certain things could have been accentuated to exaggerate and enhance this original concept. Small parts of the film, like some of the slowed down sequences, felt unnecessary and slowed the film down, and I also felt the film could have been pushed even more. I know that seems hard to state, considering the amount of grotesque, self-mutilating behaviour that occurs, but something really over the top would have really brought the shock and the self-deprecating humour out even more... such as after the anal sequence, if the intestines fell out or something equally as ludicrous. Either that, or if the anal scene was longer or contained more gruesome close ups or what have you. I also think that when our hero mutilates his face, it would have been nice had he really gone far and if his face was really quite mashed up... I think that would have enhanced the humorous aspect of the movie, as well as the horror. THat being said, the disgust and horror still emerges.The film, in its very concept, is cartoony, and the self-mutilating bludgeoning was very comical. The film and the credits are low-fi and simply done. The camera-work works for what it is, and there is a nice shot when our hero is riding the hammer and he looks up with a look of absolute terror on his face. It really enhances the absurdity and terror of the moment.For me, the most fascinating quality about the film was the idea that the horror is created by the victim, who is both victim and terrorizer. It's also interesting how a hammer, a typically 'male' tool, is used in the film.. especially since a hammer seems the archetypal heterosexual male instrument. the filmmaker seems to be making a statement about masculinity and it's role in horror films... The film seems to be poking fun at the 'inner voice' that's heard in umpteen horrors and thrillers. I found myself wondering about the character... who is he? where is he coming from? what are the pills? and i wonder if the film would have been stronger had these questions been answered. I cannot say. But I found myself wondering what led him to self mutilation and sodomy and wonder if it would have added an extra layer to the film, had we seen the transformation. Otherwise, it's horrific and disturbing, but inexplicable.It's not perfect, and could have been tighter and elements could have been enhanced to bring out the horror and comedy even moreso, but that being said, the film was well done, well edited and manages to shock.

It usually reeks of pretension, as if the filmmaker is saying, \"My film is so important, it doesn't need trivialities like suspense.\" But done thoughtfully, the technique can build tension and draw in the viewer rather than alienate. This is the Case in The Upside of Anger, which leads off with a scene with the main characters on their way to a funeral. Director Mike Binder uses this to advantage, however, so that each scene is imbued with tension it otherwise would have lacked. Of course the ending will be the hook that draws most into conversation about this film. Is it manipulative? Does it fit? I argue not only does it fit, it gives you two films in one; the one you just saw and the one which you will replay in your mind given the ending. The film is not without flaws. In family films, as with actual families, sometimes one child is given less attention. In Upside, it's Keri Russell's character who almost seems to be from a different family altogether. This may be Binder's point, but by not amalgamating characters, he is forced to balance too many story lines, neglecting more interesting relationships. For example, Binder's character, \"Shep,\" is a gem in this picture and really has a unique point of view. The film seemed to be begging for a final scene between \"Shep\" and Joan Allen's character. The score is also weak, relying on clichéd cues to tell us whether a scene is comic or dramatic. The strength of this picture is that it defies labels  it is a drama with comic moments  and the music belies this. In any case, every single actor is exceptional  especially Costner and Allen's. Every time Costner seems to have slipped into parody, he delivers one of these sublime performances that remind you why he's a screen idol. And if Allen isn't nominated for awards aplenty for her work here, I suppose that would be the downside to The Upside of Anger.","rw1134411","Joan of the story arc","riderpridethemovie",0],[["4","10"],"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)","10","25 July 2005","Charlie And The Chocolate Factory will be labeled and looked at as (what most movie fans fear) a remake.

Willy Wonka is a candy god. The world worships him. Then for reasons which I will not explain because that would spoil the movie for you he closes his candy factory forever. Then out of the clear blue he decides that he is not only going to open the doors again but he is going to allow five lucky children to tour his factory, something that has never been allowed before. He runs this contest by putting five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The five lucky kids are Augustis Gloop a heavy kid from Germany who lives, breathes, and sleeps for chocolate. Tehn we have Violet Borogard. A little girl from Atlanta Georgia who's motto is winning is everything. She hates finishing any place but the top. Then we have Veruca Salt. A spoiled little rich girl from Birmingham, England. She has a father who's opinion on the world is money can buy everything. There's also Mike Tevee who's life revolves video games. He's a snot nosed punk who will stop at nothing to insult, cut down, or humiliate anyone in his path. Then finally we have Charlie Bucket. A bright little boy who has the heart of gold. He lives in a shack with his parents and his four grandparents. They barely have any money to put food on the table. Charlie is extremely tight with his Grandpa Joe. Who fascinates Charlie with his stories of Willy Wonka. Charlie is the one child who wants this prize more than anybody and deserves it because unlike all the other spoiled brats in the film Charlie is a working class blue collar kid who you just can't help but feel bad for. After the tickets are found the children meet the man who is their hero. Willy Wonka himself played by Tin Burton alumni Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, and the upcoming animated Burton film The Corpse Bride)who holds his own as Mr. Wonka. Milly is nothing what these kids think he's going to be. He's rude, brash, and a complete wise ass. In one scene when Violet throws her arms around him and says \"I'm Violet Borogard\" Wonka looks down at her with an uncomfortable expression and replies \"I don't care\". The chocolate factory is a child's imagination come to life and no one has an eye for eye candy the way Tim Burton does. If you've never seen a Burton film then check out Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, or The Nightmare Before Christmas and you'll see what I mean. This movie has restored my faith in Burton when \"remaking\" a classic (although as i said before this film is not a remake) but I'm a Burton junkie and have loved all his movies, yes even Planet of the Apes (yes I'm the one). After the debacle that was Planet Of The Apes (2000) it looked like Burton's career was over. The movie was a bomb and loathed by most fans that saw it basically giving a lot of heat about the ending (although P.O.T.A. has a better ending than the recent War Of The Worlds remake I've been told)but Burton bounced back with the masterpiece Big Fish. He hasn't dropped the ball since. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is one of Tim Burton's best films and has great eye candy as well as laugh's with Depp's Wonka and the Oompa Loompa's (all played by one man who's been CGI'd to make millions of Oompa Loompa's) and the songs in the films are funny as hell. As for Depp, he hold's his own as Willy Wonka. Believe me he has some big shoes to fill from Gene Wilder's Wonka. However as I said before this movie is so different from the original it falls into the apples and oranges category. It's hard to compare which one is better. The original is still a great film that I will always love. Burton's version ranks right up there with it. Burton's version is almost scene for scene, word for word just like the book. The original is not even close. Which is why I can't even compare the two as well as tell you who was the better Willy Wonka. Again apples and oranges. If you want a good time at the movies where you can just leave your brain at the door and get lost in a weird, wonderful world then i highly recommend Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Burton fans will love it. It ranks up there with Sleepy Hollow, Mars Attacks, Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, and Big Fish. Even people that have never seen a Burton film (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetle Juice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow, Planet Of The Apes, Big Fish and the upcoming Corpse Bride) will have a tough time not enjoying Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. It's a great time at the movies. Heck you'll find yourself wanting to go by candy as soon as the credits begin to roll. On a scale of 10 I give Charlie And The Chocolate Factory a 10. Go and enjoy. You won't regret it.","rw1134412","One Of Tim Burton's Best Films!!!!!","FMACDONALD",1],[["14","31"],"Wedding Crashers (2005)","1","25 July 2005","There is so much wrong with this movie, I could be here a week typing this. But one of the most glaring missteps (for lack of a stronger word) is the homophobic element surrounding the character of Todd. Portrayed as \"crazy,\" \"weird\" and \"scary\" the film takes the gay stereotype of over 30 years ago and resurrects it. It also makes sure to add, to comedic effect, the \"horror\" of a gay man trying to seduce a straight man. Then, add in a dash of the \"looney grandmother\" who spouts homophobic slurs for laughs. What this film does to fuel ignorance and intolerance towards gays and lesbians is no laughing matter.","rw1134413","Laced with homophobia","avanwhy",0],[["0","1"],"The Experiment (2001)","7","25 July 2005","At least Oliver Hirschbiegel (now filming the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers!) is not afraid to confront the dark historic past of Germany. Before the Oscar-nominated and critically acclaimed Der Untergang (Downfall) about the last days of Hitler he here takes on another angle of the Nazi-past: How ordinary people can become savage beasts when certain conditions arise. Here the reference to Nazis is only short (the guards make the salute to the leader in a two-second scene seen by camera) and the story can be applied much wider: To the recent American and British prisoner abuse in Cuba, Iraq and Afghanistan for example, and to war conflicts in general like the recent civil war in Bosnia.That this is only based on the original Stanford Prison Experiment and could not be a real experiment is not important here. The same underlying principles at work could give this outcome and the movie makes that painstakingly clear. Slowly the guards and prisoners dehumanize each other; rules set out are broken; violence used when forbidden; leadership taken on and taken over; one person (the journo!) stirring at all. Some have noted here that the whole process goes a little fast, but there are some big time lapses in the movie. The military man Steinhoff seems the only one early acknowledging the forces at work here, as he has gone through it all in his military training and service. It makes perfectly clear how rapidly personal frustration leads to Nazi-like behavior.This is also somewhat convenient for Germans (Serbs, etc.) facing their recent history, as there is a rational explanation for war crimes and we can all sleep comfortably now. Of course other forces (political, cultural and social) are at work to create the circumstances and while serving as an explanation, there is always individual responsibility. A good idea would therefore have been to show part of the trials in one way or another.Using the thriller-format is a good choice, because it keeps the audience on board to convey a deeper message. The limited budget and Hirschbiegel's background as director of TV-movies shines through with a completely redundant love interest, a very slow start and some camera-work from TV-land. But once the experiment starts, there is also the restriction of space present where these problems shift to the background. And the story itself is so compelling you will soon forget about the cinematic restrictions. This is also very well paced and seen on a stand-alone basis a very good thriller anyway.This is extremely powerful stuff. It is shocking and most viewers will probably be thinking about this some weeks after the experience.","rw1134414","Confronting the past","diand_",0],[["19","26"],"Revolt of the Zombies (1936)","2","24 July 2005","\"This might mean the end of the white race!\" gasps a general as a dozen Native Zombies wander around the battlefields of Europe during the \"Great War\". An expedition sets out tor the long-lost, back-projected city of Kennif-Angor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent honest white people to slaughter each other by the tens of thousands.It is a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as the acting is so wooden. Even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is bad. From a previous decade. It looks like it came out of a correspondence school text book on 'How to Act' ------------- Chapter Three: Emotions -------------\"How to express fear and loathing (Female) Clench both fists. Place fist of one hand on heart. Open mouth as it to scream. Place other fist, palm out, against mouth. Hold pose for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable then quickly turn head 90 degrees away from direction of loathed object and sob\".\"How to have difficult, heavily emotionally charged scene with ex-fiancé explaining your love for someone else. Do NOT make eye contact. Do not move. Do not show any emotion. Do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines off the studio wall.\" To give us a respite from the leaden acting the director cunningly cuts in long pauses where nothing much happens except that film keeps running through the projectors. Thus 35 minute's worth of story is padded out to 60ish minutes.The revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow! Released from mental bondage the armies of ex-zombiefied minions turn on their former master by ambling slowly up hill and then sort of stabbing a door a bit and smashing a window. \"Yea... let's... oh, I dunnno yeah. Let's get him grrr. Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana.\" (though I have just found a bit of hidden symbolism. Jagger is shot by a Native as some sort of ironic counterpoint to all the Natives being shot by the Germans at the start of the flick. see, even downtrodden Natives don't want the end of the White Race!) The chase (it you can call it that) through the back-projected swamp is hilarious and worth the admission price alone. Roy D'Arcy has a hell of a time camping it up, but is totally wasted, as Col. Mazovia.There is one interesting moment in this film. A nice little montage of the zombied natives and white cast members falling under the evil eyes spell. face after face, cross-fade into one another. It works, though there is a strange little blip in the middle of each close up like a frame has been cut. I guess these must be Neg Cutters' frames between the fades.Best watched with friends and in a silly mood.","rw1134416","Plod Plod Plod...","junk-monkey",0],[["1","7"],"The Devil's Rejects (2005)","4","24 July 2005","As I sat in the theatre prior to the start of Rob Zombie's new violent bloodbath, The Devil's Rejects, a young couple entered and sat in front of me. They were 18 or 19 tops and came in hand in hand. She looked as wholesome as Laura Ingalls and he looked like he could have come straight from choir practice. He held down the seat for her and then offered to go out for popcorn or a drink if she so desired. They seemed as innocent and as pure a couple as I had seen a young pair in some time.This was going to be good.The Devil's Rejects doesn't take long to reveal the type of film to which the next 90 or so minutes will be spent. A towering creature of a man with a bag over his head carries a fully naked dead woman by the feet through the woods. Before the opening credits are revealed, there is a stabbing, a scene where the living lay in rest next to the naked bodies of the dead, multiple images of dead corpses in various stages of decay and a police shootout that leaves a few cops on the wrong side of living.We were now only a few minutes into the film and already I was having just as much fun watching the reactions of the two in front of me as I was savoring the gratuitous violence displayed on the large screen. He looked to be somewhat enjoying himself, while she was definitely not amused. More on them later.The Devil's Rejects follows the violent exploits of the Firefly family. They are a murderous family that are responsible for countless disappearances and deaths in the Texas area. But when the Texas Rangers lead by Sheriff Wydell lead a raid on the House of Corpses, Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sherri Moon) and clown faced Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) go on the run leaving a trail of blood and bodies from film set to film set.The fist stop is at a run down motel where two unsuspecting couples become hostages for Otis and Baby. Their encounter is both obscene and disturbing and anyone who knows Rob Zombie knows that the ending to their ordeal will not be pleasant. Some are shot, all are humiliated and what the final survivor is subjected to is that of NC-17 and X-rated thinking.It was here that the girl sitting in front of me left for the first time. I could tell since she didn't whisper over to her mate that she was going to the washroom, or grabbing a drink, that it was just too much for her at that time. I was distracted from the film somewhat as I was trying to keep an eye both on the action unfolding and the reaction of the young man. Would he leave too? Is he wondering where she might be? He actually looked confused about her departure. Not concerned mind you, but concerned.She returned about 10 minutes later. Didn't ask what had transpired in her absence and continued to watch the film as if a fresh air break was an essential requirement. The next scene took the evading Firefly family to a whorehouse community where they met up with king pimp Charlie (Ken Foree). Drugs, partying and sex ensue, so I again was distracted by the youngins.She now showed all the signs of someone who was incredibly uncomfortable and ready to leave at any time. She held her head against her fist. She ran her fingers through her hair with every bloodsplat and she would shake her head side to side in a disagreeing fashion as the violence continued to escalate.By the time Sheriff Wydell hires two thugs to help capture the family so that he could take them back to their home (yeah, that makes sense) and inflict his own brand of justice, she had reached the end of her tether and walked out for now the third time. As the final shoot-out ensued, she came back, took the hand of the young man who I am guessing picked the film of viewing that evening and walked out.The above story is exactly whey I can't recommend The Devil's Rejects. Although the film pays homage to the drive in movies and low budget horror flicks of the seventies, it just doesn't fit in circa 2005. Also known as House of 1000 Corpses 2, this was Rob Zombie's second stab at terrorizing those brave enough to pay for his efforts. House of 1000 Corpses ended up on my worst of list a few years back and although The Devil's Rejects doesn't get my validation, it is a step up from his previous attempt. The only problem is that the step up lead to a step out the aisle and countless steps towards the car in what has to be the worst date movie choice since I brought my fiancée to see Thelma & Louise while trying to make up for a fight.","rw1134417","A bloodbath of brutality - not your ideal date movie","gregsrants",1],[["4","9"],"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)","10","24 July 2005","Well.I've heard so many bad remarks about this movie.so I'm gunna say what i think.

It really takes you back to your teen years, especially if you ever babysat and wished for some excitement instead of boredom. Chris Parker (a marvellous Elisabeth Shue) is a beautiful high school senior who was anticipating celebrating with her boyfriend, Mike (Bradley Whitford) regarding their anniversary. However, the jerk (as the viewers know) stands her up with some really lame excuse and she ends up babysitting for the Andersons, who have a very curious and adorable daughter, Sara, (Maia Brewton) and a teenage son, Brad, (Keith Coogan, grandson of the great Jackie Coogan) who secretly makes puppy eyes at Chris. Brad's obnoxious best friend, Daryl (Anthony Rapp) shows up and wants in when Chris receives a frantic phone call from her best friend, Brenda (a wonderfully comedic Penelope Ann Miller), who has run away from home, only to be stranded at a downtown Chicago bus stations with some really pricelessly goofy characters. Our heroine dares to take the rugrats with her to rescue her pal, and they encounter one outrageous adventure after another. In the process, they blow a tire, meet up with an amputee truck driver, witness an assault, end up being dragged down to a automobile heisting operation, chased by the bad guys, singing in a blues club (one of the best sequences), come between a gang war on a subway, crash (almost literally) a frat party, and discover that Chris's guy has been two-timing her with an \"easy chick\", and end up at the Anderson's party downtown. And they do, finally accomplish their mission to rescue Brenda, while trying to beat the progenetors home!!! Whew!!! No wonder Chris decides that this is going to be her first and last job!!!! The 60s soundtrack does nothing to hurt the film, in fact, it enhances it, especially the opening track, \"He Kissed Me\" by the Crystals. (A moment that every girl dreams about). The situations are hilarious, with as always, the charmingly clueless yuppie parents, funny villains, and resourceful protagonists. I applauded when Daryl returned a long overdue favor to Mike in the French restaurant, and the facial expression on Daryl's face on the freeway when they are approached by \"Handsome\" John Pruitt just takes the cake!!!

Sorry - claiming to be related to Aunt Nellie and Uncle Ed, or whatever, would never, ever get them to the villa or on the yachts. Once identified, the Secretary - and his daughters - would never have allowed them to marry these two grifters. I don't care how egalitarian we pretend to be - it would never occur.

The use of vertical angles as a visual motif, and the love affair that Boorman's camera has with the architecture and settings throughout the film can clearly be seen in later works by directors as diverse as Quentin Tarantino and Jim Cameron. Los Angeles becomes a character under Boorman's skilled stewardship, here closing in on Marvin and his enemies with the stark diagonal planes of the LA river basin storm drains, there opening up the world as Marvin stalks the Hollywood hills with the city laid out beyond him in magnificent, eye-popping clarity.The story is one of passion, treachery, and revenge; the mechanics of the story are implicit not only in the spare, at times near-impressionistic dialogue, but in the stunning visuals Boorman's camera utilizes. From the acid-trip grooviness of the backstage nightclub battle, with the action reflected and commented on by the models' faces cast huge on a projected screen, to the splashes of psychedelic colour on Marvin's face at the conclusion of the scene, colour, lighting and angles are counted on to carry so much of this story -- and they bear the burden well.I don't know if Patrick McGoohan was thinking of this film when he created The Prisoner, but fans of that series will also see echoes on the screen, in the way each scene is colour-coded across the board. On the commentary track, Boorman talks at length about his theories of colour in relation to the film, and it's a lesson with strong practical applications for anyone working with colour, in movies, comics, or any artform.Point Blank is a movie I know I will be returning to again and again, to relish Marvin's primal scenery-chewing presence, and to bask in the glow of Boorman's vivid colour choices, so wonderfully recaptured on this DVD. If you want to tell stories, or if you just enjoy them being told to you well and with a challenging wit and intelligence, Point Blank is absolutely indispensable viewing.","rw1134421","Indispensable, Rock-Hard Neo Noir","alandaviddoane",1],[["14","23"],"Torque (2004)","10","24 July 2005","if they just cut out saying 'bitch' a few times i would give it a ten. the plot is shakespearian. the dialog is really corny but the film makes fun of its own dialog via the relationship between the 2 lead characters. the fbi cop is amazingly cast and so his his side kick. he is like some starbucks sarcastic teenager who got a hummer for his birthday.the visuals, though, are what make this movie. they are absolutely crazy. even with the matrix and all the other movies like it, the visuals in this film are still quite something to see. they have unusual angle changes, strange lighting, atmospheric effects, zooms, low angles of motorcycle chases, etc. there are numerous times where a 0.5 second frame is injected in a really weird manner that is quite striking, such as when the woman pushes the trigger on the explosives, or when the bike rider flips up her knife in slow motion and catches it. the shot of ice cube looking at 'ford' through the train is also quite striking.the stunts are incredible ... the product placement is completely over the top and obvious in a really silly way, but somehow it fits with the movie, because the movie is over the top in a really silly way too. and motorcyclers and racers really do have corporate logos pasted all over their bodies so it doesn't seem ridiculous.the evil woman reminds me of a Disney villain from Cinderella or something. if you stop trying to analyze everything so much you just might have a jolly good time eating popcorn as you watch the explosions and motorbikes flying all over the screen.","rw1134422","this movie is completely ridiculous, but i love it -spoiler-","fliphop",1],[["27","28"],"All That I Need (2005)","9","24 July 2005","The audience gets to play proverbial fly on wall at the posh \"meetings\" and one helluva grand finale of the pyramid, Muffin Club.

Even though TCM gave it 1.5 out of 4 stars, I just couldn't resist a 1931 pre-Code with handsome Ramon Navarro, so I gave it a whirl.Handsome Austrian lieutenant Willi (Navarro) meets virgin music instructor Laura (Helen Chandler), pursues her, gets her drunk, spends the night with her. She's in love, but he thinks it was just fun and games. He leaves her 100 gilder on the breakfast table. (Note to pre-Code fellas: when you spend the night with an innocent girl, don't leave her money in the morning; you will only insult her and turn her into a prostitute for real as she wreaks revenge on you while feeling she's good for nothing else now that you've defiled her -- Freddie March made the same mistake in 1934's \"We Live Again\" -- tsk tsk).Her heart hardened, Laura calls up Herr Schnabel (Jean Hersholt), a rich brute of a man whom Willi previously saved Laura from. In front of Willi, Laura tells Herr S. that she's \"willing to accept your previous invitation ... and quite completely.\" We get the drift; Laura becomes Herr S.'s mistress and is transformed from shabbily dressed music instructor to kept woman in fancy new apartment with a new wardrobe and dripping in diamond jewelry.Willi truly does seem to love Laura, and wants to make amends for ruining her life. Laura tells Willi that if he has more money than Herr S., that she will go with him. Willi plays chemin-de-fer (baccarat) with Herr S., but loses 14,000 gilder to him, which he must pay by noon the following day. As he leaves the casino, Laura gives Willi her address; he is waiting in her apartment when she arrives home. They kiss, and Laura tells Willi this is now \"Act 2\". They spend the night together, and in the morning she is now the one who is leaving money for him. She tells him over breakfast: \"I'm a businesswoman now... You taught me how to make love without meaning a word that I say. I amused you once, and you paid me. Well, you're as handsome as ever and just as amusing. I return the compliment,\" as she reveals the money she's hidden under his breakfast plate.Willi, determined to prove his love for Laura, leaves the money there and prepares to pay his debt by committing honor suicide. Willi's rich uncle, unable to bear the thought, offers to pay his debt but only if Willi will marry Emily, a member of a wealthy upper class family. Willi would rather die than marry Emily. Willi offers instead to quit the army, get a regular job, marry the woman he loves, and repay his uncle over time. At first the uncle rebuffs this idea, but in the end accepts rather than see Willi kill himself.Next scene: Laura is teaching music again.

Willi and Laura kiss. The End.This movie also had some hilarious moments to it, if I may continue on with the spoilage: 1 - Willi's manservant Josef, who loves to parade around Willi's apartment wearing Willi's underwear; and who, when kicked in the rump from Willi for burning him with a hot towel, says \"Thank you sir.\" He seemed to enjoy that kick! 2 - Willi hanging out with a prostitute at a fancy bar, Herr Schnable walks by and tells him, \"Hope you wouldn't do anything I wouldn't do\", to which Willi replies slyly with a slight raise of one eyebrow, \"We're going to do something you *couldn't* do!\" 3 - Willi donning his hat and checking himself out in the mirror after spending the first night with Laura; he tells his reflection \"Just as handsome as ever!\" 4 - The music student's parents believe Willi to be Laura's cousin. When Willi and Laura are kissing passionately at the end of the movie, the parents look on smiling but then, realizing \"oh hey, aren't they cousins?\" they turn and give each other a puzzled \"what the hell????\" kind of look. It was pretty darned funny actually.Sometimes these 1- or 1.5-star flicks on TCM are duds, sometimes they are enjoyable little trifles such as this.

These individuals also tend to criticize everything to the outmost detail and tend to forget that these are ONLY MOVIES!(ii) Lucas Geeks who worship the man and will give all his movies 10 star ratings, even if the movie was a lump of crap sitting there stinking it up attracting flies for 2 hours (and let me tell you this movie is not far off!). There is a third segment of us, that while being die-hard fans of the first three movies still are willing to give the second trilogy a chance, but are critical of what we see as mediocre attempts to relive a great trilogy.I consider myself part of number 3, which you will see in my reviews of all the Star Wars movies. I have Sith 7 stars, this 1 and will give clones 4 when my reviews are finished on this trilogy. Phantom Menace is half C Span and half kiddy movie.

It is over some sort of blockade by the trade federation over the planet Naboo. If they have a problem why don't they just slap some tariffs on Naboo and let it be. Anyhow, there are the usual chases and star wars effects, none of which seem to work. The underwater chase especially is very boring.

The original Vacation is the best, although Christmas Vacation gave it a good run for its money. Both films are incredibly dated, but it is the savage lack of restraint or political correctness in the original that makes it worth repeat viewings. 1983 was a great year for comedies that were unafraid of being labelled as being in bad taste, and director Harold Ramis had already proved his mettle on Caddyshack, one of the finest films ever made about golf. Paired with such fine actors as Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid, there was precious little that could go wrong here. When it does go wrong, the audience is too busy laughing at the other ninety nine instances where the cast and crew get it right to care. Unlike many other comedies where jokes are deleted because they didn't test well, Vacation simply leaves the failures behind and moves on to the next.The plot concerns itself with one Clark Griswold, a designer of food additives who wishes people would take him more seriously. He takes his family on a road trip across the USA, with the final destination being a theme park known as Wallyworld. Wallyworld being a cheap knock-off of Disneyland, naturally. None of the film is really rooted in reality, as the moment when the old Griswold family car is ceremoniously towed off to be crushed at the car dealership. Maybe it is meant to demonstrate how spineless a man Clark is, but even the most timid man would file complaints or sue if the vehicle he ordered turned out to not be there on the delivery date, and his old car was written off. Clark's spinelessness is a two-edged sword. It drives the comedy very effectively in some scenes, but it grates in others. As I have more or less indicated, it only works when there is no good reason for him to be more aggressive.The plot thread with Clark lusting after a babe in a Ferarri (that is more or less how she is billed) is incredibly dated nowadays. Christie Brinkley puts in a great performance as the piece of tail that this spineless wimp keeps chasing in spite of the fact that he should know this woman is so out of his league. Dana Barron and Anthony Michael Hall are great as the long-suffering Griswold children, who alternate between being amused at the misadventures on the road and reflecting on what a big wuss their father is. Observant viewers will noticed that Anthony Michael Hall grows a foot or two between the introductory sequences and the arrival at the Griswolds' destination. John Candy gets a great cameo as a security guard who seems as spineless as Clark. But it is Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Jane Krakowski, John Navin, and Imogene Coca as Ellen's relatives who make the film as funny as people remember. One almost wishes there could be a film entirely devoted to these idiots.For sure, Vacation is incredibly dated, and some of the humour in it has been lost to time. It has also spawned more sequels than any franchise this ordinary deserves. Then again, you could not have Christmas Vacation without European Vacation, so I guess we should take the good with the bad. Anthony Michael Hall has defied expectations and had a decent career since, while Dana Barron and most of the rest of the cast have seemingly dropped off the face of the Earth. Chevy Chase has basically been reduced to the B-list, making the kind of films that rarely get released on video outside of America, if at all. Fortunately, director Harold Ramis has gone onto much bigger and better things, as an actor, director, and a writer. Unfortunately, this kind of B-level comedy that used to fill the rental shelves has been phased out in favour of politically correct drivel. I guess some you win, some you lose.I gave Vacation a six out of ten. Unlike some other comedies that have \"this is a product of the 1980s\" stamped all over them, it has not aged well. It is, in fact, quite a step down from Caddyshack, Chevy Chase's previous collaboration with Harold Ramis. Still, if you are bored and could do with some nostalgia, Vacation might be worth a try.","rw1134434","1980s B-grade comedy at its most... average","mentalcritic",0],[["3","4"],"Embrace the Darkness 3 (2002 Video)",null,"23 July 2005","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*A sexy vampire decides she's had enough of her boring vampire lover and makes him hit the road.

His name is synonymous with many things, including a campaign to get people to have regular visits with the optometrist (a popular poster in optometrist offices began with the headline \"Ray Charles should not be blind\"). Throughout his life, he projected the image of a man who should be loved, in spite of some very serious character flaws. Children of the era I grew up in knew him mainly as an eccentric musician who, in spite of being as blind as a bat, was more full of life than many people who were in full possession of all their senses. Ray as a film tries to uphold that image that many of us have of the man, but it also digs deeper to produce the story of a man who lived with many demons, and thus was not necessarily a saint. Some would call it blasphemy to show Ray Charles as a womanising drug addict, but in doing so, the film goes to its glory.The film covers the period from when Ray Charles began what would eventfully become an illustrious career as a musician to the time he kicked a heroin habit. A few details outside of this period are added in the form of flashbacks, usually to explain some of the more peculiar details of his character. For example, when we are told that Ray never used a cane or a guide dog, we get a flashback of his mother, played with an obvious enthusiasm by Sharon Warren, teaching him how to pay more attention to his surroundings, using the audio cues to guide him. The scenes with a young Ray, played by C.J. Sanders, slowly going blind from glaucoma, are almost enough to bring tears to the eyes. In playing the adult Ray, Jamie Foxx wore eye prosthetics that really left him blind during much of the principal photography. A small detail that might seem, but this kind of dedication to one's art is admirable, and it shows throughout the film.The film is a study in the two addictions that dominated Ray Charles' life. Early on in the film, the aforementioned mother makes him promise that he will not live like a cripple, as she more or less puts it. Physically, he keeps his promise, but it is the emotional side where he falls down, and this becomes obvious as his womanising ways add up to more sticky situations than most of us will have if we live five lifetimes. But it is the heroin addiction that really bookends the film, and it is no coincidence that the film mainly covers the years in which this addiction had a hold of him. Towards the end of the film, as the Ray on film is entering rehabilitation in order to avoid prison, or so the film has it, we get one of the best \"you broke your promise\" scenes I've seen on film in years. From this point, we go to the scene with Georgia rescinding its ban against Ray Charles performing there, and the film succeeds in what most biopics of this nature fail at. Depicting a triumph over adversity without being sappy. Kerry Washington's line says it all: you cannot feel sorry for someone that you respect.I admit it, I am a sucker for stories that depict a human being overcoming adversity. What makes Ray so compelling is that the man in question was very real, and the adversity he overcame was so great. In this day, where governments are imposing more tax upon us than medieval Kings imposed upon serfs, it is scarcely imaginable that there will be others like him anytime soon. Indeed, some disabilities that seriously impair lives can remain undiagnosed for decades, leaving us with stark reminders that for all the social changes that have taken place since the time depicted here, we are still no further forward. Perhaps life is meant to be a struggle, and Ray Charles understood this better than any of us. For 150 minutes, Jamie Foxx does not just play Ray Charles. For all practical purposes, he is Ray Charles for that short span of time. In turn, the film highlights a good reason why governments are now trying to socially engineer us away from music. Music has the power to unite people, to turn the poorest among us into the richest (and I do not mean in monetary terms). Just as Ray Charles exemplified this fact in his lifetime, so too does Ray the film.The only flaw I found in the film was that the actors portraying Ray's supporting musicians were somewhat flat, and the film seemed to die in the last fifteen minutes before Ray's triumph over heroin addiction. For these reasons, I gave the film a nine out of ten. It is not the best film I have ever seen, but it is a fitting tribute to a truly indomitable spirit. It deserves to be seen at least once.","rw1134436","A strange look into the life of a truly great man","mentalcritic",0],[["9","11"],"Malibu Eyes (2004 Video)",null,"24 July 2005","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* I rented \"Malibu Eyes\" because I thought it was going to be another sex flick. The description sure sounded like it was going to be: Young girl in a beach house spies on her neighbors etc. But I'm afraid \"Malibu Eyes\" has pretensions to be something far more than that. It is trying, and I emphasize trying, to be some sort of thriller in which Hannah watches people and in turn is watched by a mysterious stranger. Were the filmmakers trying to tip us off with the palindrome name HANNAH? Hannah gets it both ways. She watches them, they watch her. I watch all of them and cry all night long. It's a vicious cycle.\"Malibu Eyes\" is a stinker. It's shot on cheap video and looks tacky. What the heck am I watching? More importantly, where's the sex? If Hannah loves watching people, why can't she watch something interesting? Who knew spying in neighbor's windows could be so dull? Hannah even has a secret camera in her sunglasses. So she wanders around the beach looking like one of the ladies from \"Invasion of the Bee Girls\". It's preposterous and pathetic. The real kick in the groin with this one is that any remote semblance of a payoff scene is shot so ineptly that you can't make out what's going on. Any nudity or sex scene is handled badly. The only reason for watching Hannah the voyeur is to see what she sees and she better see something worthwhile. You see? Better yet, don't see this one.

By a different time, I mean a time when the idea of a feature film being digitally photographed was more impressive than it is now. While digital cinematography is still very much in its infancy, filmmakers have already begun to realise that its novelty alone cannot save a film from mediocrity. George Lucas showed this much on Revenge Of The Sith, and Robert Rodriguez made a valiant effort to show he understood this with Once Upon A Time In Mexico. Kerry Conran, on the other hand, demonstrates no understanding of this simple fact on Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow. Much of the film feels like a mish-mash of digital effects, and while there is nothing necessarily wrong with this, it becomes painfully obvious in a hurry that there would be nothing to the film without them.The cast are essentially lost in a sea of effects without a paddle. Sir Lawrence Olivier would cry blasphemy if he knew his image was being stitched into a film like this. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law have all the on-screen chemistry of dead ducks. Neither are really the most capable of actors, but Law did once prove in Enemy At The Gates that he can act when the material is right. Paltrow, on the other hand, proves that the blonde reporter woman archetype of the 1940s era film is probably best forgotten. Angelina Jolie could have saved the film, and the scenes featuring her cool, charming presence do lift the tone when they come, but her role is little more than an extended cameo. It is not as perfunctory as Christopher Lee's walk-on during Revenge Of The Sith, but one could have erased her from this turkey without making the slightest dent. But that would also entail eliminating the only actor who displays any range. At least she reacts differently to massive flying machines trying to shoot her down, compared to a meeting with an old friend.The plot, such as it is, features machines of various design attacking such locations as New York City, and disappearing into parts unknown. The titular Captain of the piece leads a group of mercenaries who are charged with the task of tracking them down and doing whatever they deem necessary to stop future attacks. At one point, he is assisted in this by a Captain of the Navy who sounds more like she ought to be in porn films. The plot is set in motion by pasted footage of Lawrence Olivier explaining a mad plot to kidnap a handful of scientists from around the world. For purposes that, when explained towards the end, really reduce this film to little more than a James Bond prequel. That is all one really needs to know about the film, and by the time the film is over, that is all that anyone really does know. The dialogue is not so much delivered as it is recited, and the actors make it patently clear at all points that they are reacting to nothing. True, it is a challenge to act for something that will be pasted in later, but after Ian McKellen did such a smashing job of it in the one good Lord Of The Rings film, excusing actors on this basis is no longer \"on\", so to speak.And that is basically where it all falls down. People have criticised two of the Star Wars prequels for being nothing but a hundred million dollars worth of special effects in search of a plot. What they do not realise is that in spite of threadbare writing, these two films at least gave us characters we could care about. In spite of a plot more complicated than it really needs to be, and the fact that I knew the outcome before it began, I ground my teeth together during every step of Obi-Wan Kenobi's frenetic battle with Darth Maul. In spite of the fact that it had all the supporting drama of a tennis ball. This, friends and neighbours, is because the character had personality and charisma in his own limited way. Once Angelina Jolie is out of the picture, Sky Captain gives itself nothing to hang itself on. Jude Law has lost the ability to carry a feature film on his shoulders, and Gwyneth Paltrow never had it to begin with. Roger Ebert compares this film with Indiana Jones, which is one of the most misplaced comparisons I have ever heard of. I gave a damn about Indiana Jones. In fact, I gave more than a damn, because Indiana Jones in all of its iterations so far have been some of the greatest adventure films ever made. Sky Captain is a minor twitch of the cheek by comparison.Because of a total lack of emotional investment or interest I had in the film from beginning to end, I rated it a two out of ten. If it had been bad enough to be entertaining, that would have at least been something. I therefore have no qualms about saying that Ed Wood could direct a better film than Kerry Conran.","rw1134438","Ho hum","mentalcritic",0],[["36","53"],"Wild Things: Diamonds in the Rough (2005 Video)","1","23 July 2005","One really has to feel for Dina Meyer as she struggles through this C-level production. The law of diminishing returns pretty much states that the more one tries to repeat an accomplishment or action, the less successful the results will be. Most film franchises conform to this rule faithfully, with the latter episodes in the Police Academy or Aliens series managing to plumb depths in their respective genres that used to keep television programmers well-stocked for early-morning material. There are also exceptional sequels, the second Star Trek or X-Men films being good examples. The third Wild Things film is the same thing to late franchise entries as Police Academy: Mission To Moscow. The most telling sign of the third Wild Things film being crap is that it did not even receive so much as a direct to video release. This was filmed with cable, or even free to air, television in mind. My guess would be one of those hotel cable channels where they screen not-quite-porn for desperate customers who have nothing better to watch.Like the previous two Wild Things films, Diamonds In The Rough attempts to create a twisting and turning plot for the titillation of the viewer. While Wild Things 2 succeeded by completely recycling the plot of the highly entertaining original, Diamonds In The Rough attempts to recreate the mild revival of the erotic thriller without resorting to recycling the screenplay or screen composition of the original. Calling it moderately, or even mildly, successful would be flattering. Diamonds In The Rough is a failure thanks in no small part to a pace that is so rushed it feels incoherent. An attempt to recreate the threesome scene is made, and it has the virtue of both women getting naked in front of the camera, but it goes by so quickly that viewers are often hard-pressed to remember anything about it mere minutes after viewing. Sandra McCoy apparently suffered a fifty-percent pay cut for hiring a body double in this film. That should summarise how much dedication to one's art this film inspires.Dina Meyer essentially jumps into the role played by Terence Bridge in the previous film, and by Kevin Bacon in the one before that. She is about the only person in this film who can act, and the screenplay does a good job of obscuring this. The dialogue is not exactly daft, but it really only fills space while we wait for the next display of flesh. In Wild Things, the plot was coherent and even intriguing without the little tidbits displayed during the end credits. Wild Things 2 is neither here nor there, since both the main plot and the tidbits are more or less entirely lifted from Wild Things. Diamonds In The Rough's main plot and tidbits were not written by an army of monkeys seated in front of an army of typewriters. It was vomited out by a bunch of crack-addled monkeys who bashed their heads into the keys of a bunch of typewriters for a year.My summary says it all, really. I watched Diamonds In The Rough for over an hour, even making mental notes as something particularly stupid took place. I cannot remember a singular detail of the threadbare plot, save for something to do with Dina Meyer's character being a parole officer with a personal mission. Of course, there is the usual stuff about two characters having a complex interplay relationship that turns out to be a shady criminal conspiracy. There is simply not enough screen time in this film to give this element proper development. About the only satisfactory continuance in the film comes when a line is repeated. Plot tangents are mentioned in one second, dropped like a stone in the next, and then resumed a reel or three later with not the slightest bit of linking. Perhaps it was deliberately designed to cause viewers to lose millions of brain cells in the memory area. Perhaps the film is simply so bland or stupid that, like the production of RoboCop, the mind just blanks it out like a violent crime. As I said earlier, however, it is less than a day since I watched Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough, and I am absolutely stumped when trying to recall something memorable about it.Out of ten, I gave Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough a one. It is bad enough that one could show it to people they want information or cooperation out of. After the first viewing, one is in a mildly uncomfortable mood. About halfway through the second viewing, that cyanide capsule starts to look mighty tempting.","rw1134439","So bad it could be used as a weapon of mass destruction","mentalcritic",0],[["21","32"],"I Spit on Your Grave (1978)",null,"23 July 2005","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* \"I Spit on your Grave\" is the greatest rape and revenge flick ever made. It is brutal, powerful, sleazy and exploitative. It is also quite effective and will probably leave scars on you.

Now, at this point you are expecting a rape scene. You know its coming. So the locals take her in the grass and have their way with her. It's not a very graphic rape. I was expecting to be shocked but I wasn't. It was at this point that the movie really began. As the writer walks away, she is pounced on and raped a second time. This scene was brutal. There is no music or editing done on the rape scene. It is shot as if you are really there watching it happen. She is pinned down on a rock and screams for her life. Does the movie want you to enjoy what you're seeing or would it rather have you be disgusted at the sexual violence? I don't know. I would imagine it wants it both ways. Horror fans will probably love the thrill of being shocked while others will be repulsed.What really takes \"I Spit on your Grave\" over the top is the next rape scene. Yes, she's raped a third time. She crawls back to her house and is violated again. Now we know that these men are cretins and deserve everything they've got coming to them. The rest of the movie has the writer dishing out bloody death to the lecherous men. She knows the power her body has over them and decides to use it so that she can spit on their graves.I found this movie to be a brutal gut punch. The rape scenes were tough to watch. \"I Spit on your Grave\" is not just some cheap horror flick. It is undeniably shocking and well made.

There's some decent blood and gore, a few cool fight scenes and a particularly sleazy blood sucking party at Dracula's pad. I guess Dracula's ladies would rather suck each other's blood than have to actually go out and get some themselves.But \"Dracula III\" is so relentlessly stupid and edited so badly that I started to lose interest in it by the fifteen minute mark. While I've never seen a vampire attack somebody while wearing a mask and walking on stilts, I still have to wonder why a vampire would think that that's a good idea. He wouldn't of course but the filmmakers thought it would look cool. That sums up \"Dracula III\".

The only trace of the actual book that has overtaken their determination to tribute it's first movie incarnation is the change of the Martian machines from flying lampshade type things to actual tripods. Other then that the entire film is just an attempt to put a marginally different perspective on the 50's version.To be fair, it does start out well (and there are some good cinematic moments throughout). Some claim it continues well for about 2/3rds of the film, but I think in truth it is only the first 3rd that works at all. It doesn't take long for clichés and overly predictable plot elements to creep in and there is nothing daring or risky about anything attempted by Spielberg after about 20 minutes in. It's all very well for people to go on about the focus on the main Character. But I don't think that is particularly groundbreaking. There are a good number of other directors I think can bring off a personal perspective much better so I don't think Spielberg is even playing to his strengths on this one.Plus, when you have an astronomical budget, one major star and material a good 80% of the audience will already know pretty well (anyone not know how it was going to end?), it pretty much goes without saying that people are going to want to see a lot more of the invading martians. It's all very well to point to the rules of good horror and claim not seeing stuff is suspenseful but is it entirely appropriate for this particular film? I would say not. If Spielberg wanted to do a film like that, why not come up with something fresh rather then doing a remake of a well known film based on a well known book. When you already know what is going on, there is nothing gained by not showing it.The film didn't need to worry about action clichés as in actual fact this film should never have been an action film. Humanity can't defend against these invaders, so why show anything but futility. Perhaps because that wouldn't be very Hollywood, and for all the good intentions of the film it descended into pretty standard action by the end anyway.What I would have liked to have seen would have been more dramatic spectacles, barren landscapes, shocking scenes of destruction, etc. More of the martians and perhaps show how the governments totally failed to stop them with everything they tried. They actually achieved that in the 40's film, so one of the things Spielberg did leave out was the one aspect that really gave the \"not killed by man\" aspect. As a result the very end leaves you cold, and as a big slap in the face to the book they include a voice over copied directly from the 50's film putting everything in a religious point of view (the one thing that really let down the 40's film). The book was to a large extent very anti-religious and there was no need to ignore that very important aspect of the original story. It's not even comfortably put on the end, because with the (totally unnecessary) heroic triumphs achieved by Cruise minutes early it seems like we've suddenly cut to the end of a different film.Perhaps the influence of the 50's film was too much for him. After all, anyone ever notice how similar ET looks to the aliens in the 50's film? If you were to take those aliens and make them cute, you'd end up with ET. Certainly not a co-incidence. This is very much Spielberg remaking what must have been his favourite film.One thing with Spielberg I always found annoying is his obsession with getting certificates that let kids see the film. For a start no other director could release films like this and like Jurassic park (where someones arm is ripped off his body) and get such family orientated ratings. But even with his ability to manipulate censors, he still has to hold back from making what the film should have been just for the sake of letting the kiddies see it. I guess at the end of the day it's all about money and ego and not just about making a really good film.So there you go. I gave this a disappointing 4 out of 10. It had a lot of potential but there are so many flaws and so many mixed up ideas that are never fully realised I just couldn't give it a good score. I couldn't even give it an average score, because with Spielberg, Cruise and the special effects budget I have to compare it to what I think should have been possible with the money spent and talent involved. This film is one of the great underachiever of the modern day. Compare that to the 50's film, which for the time period had stunning effects, a compelling plot and flaws that were all to understandable given the time of filming. It way ahead of it's time and is still a reasonable watch even five decades later. Can anyone honestly say this will last so well?","rw1134449","Forget the book, this is a remake of the 50's film, and a bad one!","Fenris Fil",0],[["12","12"],"The Hard Way (1980 TV Movie)","10","25 July 2005","'Less is more.' A Tribute to The Hard Way and to Patrick McGoohan.Since happening upon this film a few years ago  when I managed to win it at auction for just a few pounds - I have become so obsessed with it that I have made pilgrimages all over Ireland in order to pay homage to it, and to its leading actor, Patrick McGoohan. He is, sadly, no longer with us, along with many of the other fine actors who make up the supporting cast (Lee Van Cleef; Donal McCann; Peter Brayham; Joe Lynch). The re-release of the film on DVD, almost 30 years to the day of its original screening, is long overdue  but better late than never! It may have taken a very long time but the best things in life are always worth waiting for.In writing this review, I have struggled long and hard to articulate my feelings into words. I hope that I do justice both to the film and to Patrick McGoohan. I believe that this appearance is arguably his finest, most understated and underrated acting role ever.The plot ambles along; it is heavy and slow; there is hardly any dialogue, and very little action. Anyone looking for a fast moving 'gangster' movie peppered with gunfire (as the trailer included in the DVD's special features seems to suggest) will certainly be disappointed.The use of speech is so sparse it is almost conspicuous by its absence. Most of the scenes are eerily quiet. However, this only serves to build up the tension. The use of body language to convey mood and meaning is very subtly done; especially in the bar room 'stand off' between the two main protagonists. The way in which John Connor (Patrick McGoohan) gently menaces his 'handler' McNeal (Lee Van Cleef), and resists the latter's attempts at persuasion with a quiet, stubborn resolve, is just breathtaking to watch. I can only applaud when the former leaves with quiet dignity, then slams the bar room door behind him to signify, and release, his clearly pent-up anger. That beats any 'shoot out' I've ever seen! In my opinion, Patrick McGoohan's portrayal of the Irish mercenary who wants to retire is extremely sympathetic. He shows a man who is not just a cold-blooded killer. John Connor is very human, and has many redeeming qualities, including that of moral courage  borne out in the parting words of Kathleen (Edna O'Brien), John Connor's estranged wife, in the final scene  \"A waste of a man.\" I have to admit that, in spite of his past deeds, I have to weep for the man  I can't help it. Such is the power of the actor's presence and the skill with which he takes on the mantle of this complex character.In this respect, great credit must also be given to the skillful direction of Michael Dryhurst. Having heard that the actor and the director were very like-minded, I can well believe it when I watch the results.In addition, the stunning cinematography of Henri Decae enhances the production. Sweeping panoramic shots of the Irish countryside and the mountains contrast sharply with the claustrophobic and depressing settings of seedy hotels and dark, dingy city streets. The way the scenes are lit is also very creative and effective.The accompanying soundtrack consists of just three pieces, all of them instrumental, and each is cleverly employed to illustrate the mood of their respective scenes. 'The Dear Irish Boy', an Irish air beautifully rendered by the solo violinist Tommy Potts, and 'Events in Dense Fog,' (from Brian Eno's 'Music for Films') which accompany John Connor's sad, reflective moments, and the forlorn speeches from his estranged wife, tug at the heartstrings and bring tears to the eyes. 'Patrolling Wire Borders,' also from Music for Films (not 'A Measured Room', as is stated on the film credits), is spine-tingling, stark and sinister and is well suited to the more grimly cynical scenes of violence and turmoil in the twilight world of the jaded hit man.Very little is explained to us. There is so much we don't know; for instance, how did a man like John Connor become a mercenary? Why are his children in apparent exile in the States? And why did Kathleen, his estranged wife, then remain behind in Ireland? But somehow, this isn't all that important to know; in fact, it can only add to the appeal of the film. Not being spoon fed such details somehow piques the appetite  and that's partly why I chose not to reveal too much about the plot in this review.To cut a long story short; less is definitely more in this case. Please take the time to watch this film; be patient; and make sure you read between the lines.","rw1134450","Tragic, poignant, and definitely under-rated - less is more","carolv_brady",0],[["7","8"],"ScaredSacred (2004)","10","25 July 2005","Well, what is there to say about this great piece of art? Yesterday night on a rather artistic channel I was lucky enough to be able watch this documentary from the beginning. The images alone were really worth watching it. The viewer is taken upon a journey interviewing people from all over the world who in one way or another survived tragic events. Whether it is Hiroshima, Cambodia, Israel, Afghanistan, or Ground Zero, Velcrow shows us all sides and perspectives while making us \"breathe\" in the pain that all those people felt and still feel. Some of those stories are just astonishingly moving. A man from Sarajewo tells us about snipers that would shoot the rhythm of their national anthem. He knew that after they repeatedly \"played\" their anthem for the third time they would have to recharge their weapons. Those were the seconds he used to \"safely\" cross the street to his home. Some of the stories are not proved to be correct or accurate but they are just amazingly great. One of which is the story of a musician who was told to neither perform nor listen to music any longer. In order to ease his sufferings he started to listen to birds sing instead. After a while his house was full of birds knowing no one could forbid him having birds in his house. This goes way beyond than what mainstream documentaries pursue. It is not only about pain and suffering it is also about life as a whole. Some of the stories are philosophical and poetic.

It's more similar to \"L Age D Or\" than any of his later work. The film doesn't have any particular story, but several. Every story is hilarious as it satirizes bourgeois institutions. One incident has a stranger going up to little girls at a park and showing them pictures. Bunuel makes it appear that the pictures are dirty, as the man tells the girls, \"not to show there parents\". Later we find out the pictures are of monuments and vacation photos, nothing perverse. There's also a dinner party where guests sit on toilets around the table. And who could forget the man at the hotel into kinky S&M? The boy who has relations with his mother? And the Monks in a couple rooms over? This is all at the same hotel, too. Later a girl is reported missing, but she is right with the police man at the station. He says, \"Have you seen this girl\"? They still file a report and don't even realize she's right in front of them. I think the funniest part of the movie is the sniper. He literally shoots people for no reason while there doing everyday activities. \"The Phantom of Liberty\" is a masterpiece of not only surrealism, but of comedy too.","rw1134452","A crazy surrealist farce as only Bunuel could bring you.","NateManD",0],[["3","4"],"Wimbledon (2004)","6","25 July 2005","\"Wimbledon\" is a charming love-conquers-all romantic comedy set in the highly competitive world of professional tennis.Peter Colt is an aging player who has slipped to 119 in the world rankings; it is for this reason that he plans to hang up his racket after what he believes will be his swan song appearance at Wimbledon. What he isn't counting on is that he will meet and fall in love with a beautiful and sexy up-and-coming player named Lizzie Bradbury, a turn of events which seems to be having a very positive effect on his game. Soon, he's racking up surprise, come-from-behind wins in the tournament, becoming a major focus of attention for appreciative fans all over Great Britain. The problem is that, as Peter's game improves as a result of the romance, Lizzie's seems to be getting worse, a fact which threatens to put a serious strain on the young couple's burgeoning relationship.Although the story itself is rather innocuous and silly, Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst do achieve a genuine rapport on screen. It's also nice to have a protagonist in a romantic comedy who is not exactly in his physical prime and who is facing some of the rigors of advancing age (he's all of 30, practically his dotage when it comes to professional tennis!). Moreover, the setting is novel and there is just enough of that brittle British humor in the screenplay to keep the film from feeling puerile and canned. It's true that Lizzie seems to be an entirely different person off the court than she is on, but that is just one of those inconsistencies we tend to expect from a movie in which credibility isn't necessarily a prime factor in determining our overall enjoyment of it. And director Richard Loncraine manages to generate some genuine suspense in the final showdown between Peter and the odds-on favorite he isn't expected to beat.\"Wimbledon\" is pure Cinderella romantic fantasy crossed with a David and Goliath, underdog-takes-on-the-reigning-champ sports story.

Inspector Elliot (LEO GENN) suspects that one of the circus performers is the killer and the mastermind behind the raid. He has a number of suspects to choose from including the hooded lion tamer Gregor (CHRISTOPHER LEE) who for some mysterious reason is determined to conceal his face.

It's a disappointingly static murder mystery thriller with mild horrific overtones that wouldn't even scare your five-year-old son! It is based on an Edgar Wallace novel called AND THE THREE JUST MEN (first published in 1928), but the director who made a fine impression with his debut feature (the pseudo-American shocker CITY OF THE DEAD) is clearly uninterested in his material here. Hardly surprising since it's a very shaky plot and he seems happy to just keep the cameras immobile and leave it to the impressive cast to keep the movie afloat. Despite Lee's top billing, he gets very little to do and he wears a balaclava for most of the film.

The film isn't dark or deep enough to be considered along the same lines as the likes of Batman Begins, and at the same time it's not camp or over the top enough to be considered a 'fun' comic book flick. This is one of the main pitfalls for the film, as with this strange placing of the film; it has cut out both of the comic book audiences, and left itself with a film that is as muddled as it's lead actor's acting is weak. The plot seems to jump from one happening to another, often without any kind of explanation or logic. This makes viewing this film a very turgid experience, and the fact that the plotting is so carelessly done has also left the movie a good twenty minutes overlong; which only serves in making the film more painful. It's a shame that this film isn't better, as it has a plot that could have lent itself to a very fun flick. The plot follows John Constantine; a man that can see the demons that live among us. When policewoman Angela Dodson's sister apparently commits suicide, the two team up and discover a conspiracy beneath the surface of their native Los Angeles.Keanu Reeves often gets criticised for his acting, and for good reason - he's rubbish. He slinks his way through the film, giving the very same nonchalant emotion to every scene and event that he comes across. The good thing is that a downtrodden character like John Constantine suits him, so it's not as bad as it could have been...but on the other hand, if a talented actor were given the role; the film would have been much better. Keanu's \"Chain Reaction\" co-star, Racheal Weisz joins him again here, and pretty much does the same thing that he does - i.e. just 'appear'. You don't go into a movie like this expecting good acting really; but this film doesn't have even have 'acting'! The only performance I really enjoyed was Peter Stormare in the role of Satan, and that only lasted about five minutes. The special effects are typically dazzling, and while it's not the best CGI of all time; it's imaginatively used and provides the movie with it's main asset. It's a shame that this film is a flop, as the film noir elements of the plot could really have delivered something interesting, the subject of devils and demons always makes for fun viewing; and the recent run of comic book films has been quite impressive...but impressive, this film is not, and on the whole I recommend giving it a miss.","rw1134458","Don't expect this to be another A-quality comic book flick...","The_Void",0],[["2","6"],"The Devil's Rejects (2005)","5","23 July 2005","Rob, although many people i know did not like House of 1000 corpses, i loved it, and i waited patiently for this new movie.

Others in the large cast include Tina Aumont as the Indian girl, Michael Ansara as the Indian chief pursuing them, and Linden Chiles as his physically- inept son, Stuart Anderson, Roy Barcroft, George Wallace, Don Beddoe,.Kelly Thordsen, Nora Marlowe, and John Harmon. Director Michael Gordon kept the action and the laughs coming despite much of the film being filmed out-of-doors. the bright cinematography was supplied by veteran Russell Metty, the script by \"Maverick\" TV series alumnus Wells Root and Harold Greene, and the art direction was done by William D. DeCinces and Alexander Golitzen. Set decorations were supplied by John McCarthy Jr. and  James Redd; the vivid costume designs were created by Helen Colvig and Rosemary Odell. This is a personal favorite of mine as a writer, breezy in dialogue and attractively colorful and often amusing. I recommend it for repeated viewing, for its spaciousness and its intelligent comedy, its style and its infectious and fantasy-free good humor.","rw1134466","Breezy, Hilarious; a Classic Romantic Comedy Western","silverscreen888",0],[["1","4"],"My Fair Lady (1964)","8","22 July 2005","This film is famous for the preceding history it boasted as a fine play and successful film \"Pygmalion\" written by perverse major-talent playwright George Bernard Shaw; for the opulent production accorded its production by MGM's executives; and for the controversy surrounding the handing of its female lead to Audrey Hepburn and not to its its Broadway leading lady Julie Andrews; for the strange choices made in awarding other roles to less-than-ideal choices; and for the lovely musical additions by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederic Loewe that are perhaps more celebrated by now than even the musical film itself--numbers such as \"\"Why Can't the English Teach Their Children How to Speak\", \"With a Little Bit o' Luck\", \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\", \"The Rain in Spain\", \"Let a Woman in Your Life\", \"On the Street Where You Love\", \"I Could Have Danced All Night\", \"Get Me to the Church On Time\" and The Ascot Gavotte\", Show Me\" and \"I've Grown Accustomed To Face\", among others. The story-line of the original play is retained; and it is relatively simple. Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins encounters a colleague from India, Colonel Pickering who has come to see him, on a street outside a major theater. He criticizes a flower-girl's speech, remarking offhandedly that in six months he could her off as a lady--or a shop girl, which requires better English; that it is her accent which keeps her in lower-class poverty. The girl comes the next day, to his home where Higgins is entertaining his new guest, and offers to pay for training. Higgins is a social monster and frightens the girl with his rough talk, but he agrees to take her on, and sends her to his housekeeper to be given a bath and have her clothes burned and replaced--which act turns out to precipitate a major battle... At one point, her ne'er-do-well father, Alfred P. Doolittle, demands money to overlook the Professor's theft of his daughter, Eliza, meaning the income she had provided him; he uses the money to get married. The training proves difficult and arduous; Higgins' mother is amused and frightened by the experiment, set off by Pickering's wagering Higgins could not train the girl. But he does; Eliza proves to be bright, touchy, emotional and altogether more interesting than Higgins had expected. She succeeds, masters an upper-class accent; and then in rapid succession, she is presented at a party to social highbrows where her accent is perfect but the content of her speech is Cockney matters, which they take for a fashionable new court slang, and then she upsets the Ascot Race Meeting crying to the horse she has bet on, \"Move yer bloomin' arse!\", but charms Freddie Eynesford-Hill who becomes her shy suitor. At last the Professor presents her at a a royal ball where she charms everyone concerned, avoids any major faux pas, and convinces a bogus Hungarian phoneticist she must be royal herself. So the experiment has succeeded; Higgins has won his bet. Then he discovers, as a distraught Eliza confronts him the next day, that he has done what he had set out to do--he has created a person capable of self-assertion in the world, but not in the flawed British Empire's stratified and totalitarian society. She leaves him, to marry Freddy; and he discovers he has fallen in love with her. She recognizes that Freddy is unworthy of her and, despite the lack of promises and guarantees from Higgins, returns to do battle with him--for the rest of their lives, perhaps. The entire production looks unarguably lovely, even the Covent Garden faked scene, and a very difficult mixture of faked outdoor and elaborate indoor settings it must have been. Director George Cukor, famed for his skill with actors, gets a near-perfect job of acting from Rex Harrison as Higgins and quite a bit from Audrey Hepburn as Eliza. Others prominent in the large but briefly-seen cast include Theodore Bikel as the Hungarian hairy hound from Budapest, Mona Washbourne as the housekeeper, Isobel Elsom as Mrs Eynesford-Hill, Jeremy Brett as Freddy, Wilfrid Hyde-White as an acceptable Pickering, Stanley Holloway as Papa Dolittle, and Gladys Cooper adequate as Higgins' mother. The screenplay was by Alan Jay Lerner, and the cinematography by Harry Stradling, Sr. The production design and the lovely, colorful art direction must be credited to Cecil Beaton and to Gene Allen in both cases; Beaton also did the fabulously-expensive costumes with Michael Neuwirth. Despite its opulence, the film has consistent style, a very good flow of events and scarcely any look about it of sound-stage claustrophobia, re-hashed stage setting or extraneously-introduced musical numbers. This is a fine late musical achievement from the studio talents that produced of Hollywood's best US musicals, and the most beautiful to watch. It could have been cold and curiously overly-polished; instead it turned out to be a rather genial classic that is genuinely fun to watch in my view, and surprisingly more interesting than one had any right to expect it could be as an on-screen extravaganza.","rw1134467","Opulent, Charming and Captivating; A Very-Intelligent Late Musical","silverscreen888",0],[["61","93"],"Wild at Heart (1990)","10","22 July 2005","This is one of my favorite David Lynch films. It is also one of the more transparent, easy to understand Lynch films, although that's not the reason why it's one of my favorites. But that fact also makes Wild at Heart a good candidate for introducing someone to Lynch.On the other hand, although it's more transparent and linear on a surface level, I'm still not sure I've figured out the multilayered, bizarre subtexts and symbolism that lie deep beneath the surface--even though I've seen it a few times now. Assuming that there is indeed something to figure out. To an extent, it seems like maybe the hint of something \"deeper\" is in this case more of a red herring. This is one of Lynch's funnier films, albeit very macabre humor. It contains references to all of Lynch's most common \"content quirks\"including sequined ingénues singing jazz, manipulative housewife types, shots of asphalt speeding by, minor characters with freaky speech \"impediments\", severed body parts, and on and on--but it's almost as if he's making fun of himself. Combine that with excellent performances (including a hilarious bit part for Crispin Glover, one of my favorite actors/personalities), a sublimely incongruous score, and a retro, gripping, violent road trip saga cum romance that presages both Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994) and just about all of Quentin Tarantino's career, and you've got quite a film.Wild at Heart, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, is the tale of Sailor (Nicolas Cage) and Lula (Laura Dern), a doe-eyed, \"classy white trash\" couple. As the film starts--and what a start it is--someone tries to stab Sailor to death as he's exiting a theater. Sailor will have none of it, and Lynch begins the film on an exhilarating, brutally violent note--this is not a film for the faint of heart. To complicate matters and set up the primary conflict, we learn even before the attempted stabbing that the hit man was sent by Lula's mother, Marietta Fortune (Diane Ladd), who claimed that Sailor tried to seduce her in the bathroom (this isn't quite true, as we learn in detail later).There isn't a character in the film who isn't involved with some shady business, either presently or in the past. Sailor and Marietta's tensions stem from many years ago, when Lula was just a girl (she's supposedly quite a bit younger than Sailor). The events of the film's opening result in Sailor being imprisoned. Lula dutifully waits for his release, much to the consternation of her mom. The basic gist of the film is disarmingly simple--Sailor and Lula are headed across the country, with an eventual goal of California, as Marietta tries to arrange for Sailor to be put away for good. There are many finely realized subplots and detailed tangents, but that's the crux of the plot on the surface.In addition to his typical hyperreal/surreal weirdness, Lynch concocts a very improbable stew of influences that work together beautifully. Lula has something of an obsession with The Wizard of Oz (1939). She's haunted by visions of the wicked witch (including the \"evil cackle\"), and she sees the road trip as a veritable journey to the Emerald City. Lynch works in a lot of subtle references to The Wizard of Oz with other characters, too. Sailor is something like lounge version of Elvis reincarnated as a gangster flunky, with even better karate moves to match. Yet the two are huge heavy metal fans, especially of a band named \"Powermad\", whose music exquisitely punctuates many sequences, including some sublime dance scenes. In the first half, important scenes are set in New Orleans, with the familiar unsettling undertone that that locale often has in films--you can just smell the voodoo, sex, drugs and death bubbling beneath the skin of the city. Later scenes are set in the desolate, desert prairie country of Texas, which turns out to be even more unsettling (even though I really find such places refreshing and relaxing). There are other kinds of symbolic, stylistic and literal references worked into the film, such as the constant fire motif, which Lynch shoots beautifully, but the above is to just give you an idea of the stew.It all seems like it should add up to some subtextual grand narrative, and maybe it does, but I haven't quite figured out what it all means yet. But it doesn't matter. The stylistic flourishes are ingenious superficially, too, and maybe Lynch _is_ just poking fun at being Lynch. Here, perhaps more than in any other work, he has found the perfect balance between the soap-operatic and the utterly bizarre--the filmic equivalent to author Harry Crews' best work.Tarantino doesn't tend to have pithy subtexts in his films, either, but they're no worse the wear for that, and when Wild at Heart takes a turn into typical Tarantino territory, Lynch is just as captivating, gritty and groovy, plus he's doing it before Tarantino himself. At the same time, Lynch manages to maintain a parallel lush, erotic romance between Sailor and Lula--Dern is incredibly sexy/sensuous here. This material works as well, and supplies what just may be the message of the film after all--that love can (eventually) conquer all, even the stuff that's \"wild at heart and weird on top\".","rw1134468","Beautiful, violent, funny and surreal--a masterpiece from David Lynch","BrandtSponseller",0],[["27","33"],"The Sword of Doom (1966)","10","25 July 2005","It's not especially deep, but it's a dark and disturbing chambara about a merciless samurai, Ryunosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai), who can  and will, without hesitation  kill anybody who challenges him with a sword. He sees himself as a force of karmic balance. The film starts off with him disposing of an old man praying for death. The film is based on a newspaper serial that began in the 1910s and continued for several decades. The story never really ended, and, likewise, the film, which only covers certain bits of the novel, has no resolution. This has often bothered people, but I think it works well. Whatever the case, even if the film doesn't satisfy you as a whole, there are a number of outstanding setpieces. Nakadai's being ambushed in the forest near the beginning. The battle in the snow, where Toshiro Mifune dispatches of a dozen or more attackers while Nakadai watches cautiously from the sidelines. And that final sequence is the mother of all rampages, where Nakadai goes apesh*t in a brothel. Tatsuya Nakadai is really a fantastic actor. I know, his performance here isn't particularly complex, but he is absolutely frightening in his infinite evil. Compare this to his overwhelming humanity in The Human Condition. Okamoto's direction is assured, and Hiroshi Murai provides some of the best black & white photography ever captured. The new Criterion disc is quite good. It is without extras, but the accompanying essay is a big help at putting the film and its source material in context.","rw1134469","A favorite of mine","zetes",1],[["2","3"],"The Stunt Man (1980)","9","24 July 2005","\"The Stunt Man\" begins with an image of a vulture, which very soon after flies head-on into a helicopter, giving everyone on board the craft a momentary shock.\"That bird just tried to kill us!\" cries the helicopter pilot.\"That's your point of view,\" says a man in the back, biting an apple. \"Shall we stop and ask the bird what his was?\"\"The Stunt Man\" is a film about perspective, especially as we see director Eli Cross, the man with the apple, through the eyes of Cameron, a fugitive Vietnam veteran. Cross takes Cameron onto his latest film production after a mishap creates an opening for a new stunt man.Told he has much to learn, Cameron defensively tells his stunt coach, Chuck, \"I made it through Vietnam in one piece. That's a helluva stunt!\" But has Cameron jumped out of the pot and into the fire? He begins to think Cross is setting him up for the ultimate stunt by killing him in front of the camera. By turns flip and obsessive, Cross seems sinister even as he beguiles Cameron to step into his world. Even his very name seems to speak to this duality, suggesting both a double cross and a metaphor for a loving deity.I came to this movie by way of an excellent book by Danny Peary, \"Cult Movies 3,\" which championed \"The Stunt Man\" as a metaphysical metaphor and told the fascinating tale of how director Richard Rush struggled to get it released. Then I saw it for myself, and very quickly realized this was a classic. You have incredible camera work, hilarious dialogue, a dazzling central location at the historic Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, a wonderful sense of mise-en-scene from an assortment of colorful characters played by gifted actors, and especially a rich portrayal of Cross by Peter O'Toole.O'Toole seems so alive, you almost feel him breathing down your neck as he dips down from the heavens on his crane to offer another piece of whimsical advice. He's intense, yet even when he screams at one of his crew for yelling \"cut\" on his film, revealing some of the monster Cameron suspects lurks under his smooth surface, you, like Cameron, are unable to take your eyes off the SOB.Over the years, I've watched it a few more times and come to realize Steve Railsback as Cameron gives a performance every bit O'Toole's equal. Cameron is someone we don't know a lot about, either, other than he's in trouble and needs help. The crime he's being chased for is a mystery, though he throws up dark hints of war atrocities that might be true or else just Cameron's skewed sense of humor, projecting what he thinks others think of him, the grunt from 'Nam.Railsback was best known before \"The Stunt Man\" for playing Charles Manson, and there are times you wonder whether Cameron is a similar character. Railsback plays him as an idealist, badly bruised, with eyes that smolder with a glint of insanity every now and then. He's likable most of the time, enough for us to root for him when he falls in love with a third mysterious character, a lovely actress on the set named Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey). But we are always on guard.\"The Stunt Man\" keeps us on guard throughout, playing with our perspective by showing us seemingly straightforward scenes that turn out to be illusions or subjective visions. The film delivers several elaborate stunts, performed by Cameron on the set of Cross's World War I picture. Some like Peary complain, validly, that the stunts come off as too cartoony, not realistic as they seem to be filmed as one-take deals, and Cameron doesn't seem to know what he's doing even as he goes through his paces with apparent aplomb.But director Rush is playing with us here, delivering a subtle surreal layer to the film that keeps it (and us) off-center while simultaneously commenting on both the nature of the movies as illusion dispenser and of man's situation in a seemingly capricious and arbitrary world.The film is also very funny, so much so that many wrongly describe it as a comedy. It has some over-the-top comic moments, some slapstick, and clever dialogue throughout, but it never lets us stop worrying for poor Cameron. There are a lot of ways this film could have ended in that light, but I can't think of a better way of doing it than the way they did.About the only annoying thing for me is the business of Eli shooting an antiwar film. The metaphor seems lost in the bits of this film-within-a-film we see on screen, and the dialogue between Eli and his writer on this point drag on, except in the indirect way it creates a link with Cameron, a war veteran.So much else is great, though, I wonder how it failed to find a big audience. It's a deep, philosophical film, but with all the stunts, wonderfully goofy dialogue, and the herky-jerky romance between Cameron and Nina, there's something here for anyone who chances to see it. Like the wonderful score by Dominic Frontiere which girds the proceedings, \"The Stunt Man\" is by turns rousing, evocative, and sinister, a classic one gets lost in again and again.","rw1134470","Camera On!","slokes",0],[["4","7"],"The Andy Milonakis Show (2005–2007)",null,"25 July 2005","andy milonakis.......what can i say about andy milonakis? in all honesty, the andy milonakis show must have been the end result of a drunken discussion had among jimmy kimmel and his associates on a Saturday night. how anyone would classify this junk as \"comedy\" is, in my opinion, totally beyond me. some may say that mr. milonakis is the second coming of tom green, but in reality, this is not the case; tom green, in terms of actually funny comedy, dwarfs milonakis. tom green had a natural edge, an energy that the MTV audience could not let go of, despite his crazy antics. in laymen's terms, whatever he did, TOM GREEN WAS FUNNY.

Certainly groundbreaking and incredible to think one person made such a beautiful, well directed piece of animation that is seriously on par with the most professional 3D animated films out there now. The slow pacing of the film that allowed the viewer to be pulled into the world and recognize the beauty of some of the backgrounds and renders is very much appreciated.Unfortunately the plot was thin and eventually had no real ending. Much like many other indie animators out there, the artist made something that is only a small fraction of what probably is a grand epic in his mind. Much of the dialog and plot is petty cliché-ish holier-than-thou peace-loving hero-talk. Also, it felt very strange to watch this movie because the main character acts so odd. Some of the shots and direction seemed a bit pretentious, as well as some of the story. It's like the artist was pandering to himself by the posing of the characters. At the end I was wondering of the main character and all the other characters were homosexual. There was no story, dialog, or plot to show that but that's the only way to explain how it felt. I have nothing at all against homosexuality, I'm a huge liberal in fact, but that's what I got out of this film: an overbearing feeling of homosexuality despite the fact the film had nothing to do with that. You have to watch it to understand what I mean, just watch how it plays out, and I am not talking about Kaze acting girly or anything like that. I mean yeah, there was a lot of very overly sensitive, seemingly forced crying and emotions going on here that seemed really oddly placed, but that's only part of it. Watch it, you'll know what I am talking about when you see it. I am not joking or trying to make this movie look bad or anything, that is my honest opinion and I'm surprised no one has ever mentioned this. The reason I mention this is because it had no place in the movie and as such it detracted from the film as a whole. The artist was obviously trying to create a dramatic piece but what comes out is almost fetishistic and disturbing. If they had some sort of better reason to act this way then that would be acceptable. In fact I'd be really impressed and satisfied if a gay character in a fantasy cartoon was pulled off really well. Instead it just seems strangely out of place. Imagine all of those ridiculous movies, video games, and TV shows where an unnecessarily sexy female warrior is in a serious story. That's just pandering to the audience and the filmmakers. That's what I am talking about here, just replace her with (seemingly gay) male characters.As for the animation, it is top notch. There could be a few tweaks done to make some things seem to have more weight, and some of the action scenes seem not to fulfill what you can tell could have been great potential, but check out the rendering, the facial animation, and the emotion conveyed by all the subtle movement.The sound really needs work. Obviously the time frame of production on this film probably kept it from being better. The eerily silent parts of the film aren't artistic, rather they are annoying. The small amount of music here is great but there is very little of it. A good film doesn't need music but this film really needs something because the empty sound space, as I said before, doesn't work at all. It seems more like a huge mistake or oversight. More sound effects are needed and some of the scenes sound strange. For instance there is a scene where a chair breaks and it sounds loud but kinda like a 'generic' sound effect from a sound library. But the other sound effects are absent or very low, so the ending result is something that looks like an incomplete production.If this was a feature-length movie that explored the story in-depth, this film was definitely going in the right direction. Like I said before, the pacing and visuals of the film would have been perfect for such an endeavor. However, the artist of this film needs a solid story writer, a strong short story with a beginning-middle-end, a good sound person, and a good editor to take out some of the pretentiousness. Then he would have an award winning film. I ask you all who seem to love this film, look past how pretty it is and ask yourself does this film really redeem itself in any other ways.","rw1134472","pretty and very impressive feat, but needs a real story","zodreb",0],[["1","1"],"It Was 20 Years Ago Today (1987)","10","25 July 2005","I recorded this documentary off of the Discovery network. I played it at least a hundred times and showed it to everyone I knew. Then in about 2003 I found out there was an even longer version of the film which an acquaintance had taped from PBS. It is based on a book of the same name by Beatles publicist Derek Taylor. It really isn't just about the Sgt. Pepper album, but uses it as a platform to discuss a variety of experiments in the counterculture. Having only been 10 years old in 1967, I was clueless about these social changes. It goes into everything: experiments in the Netherlands, Hoppy Hopkins arrest for marijuana in the UK, San Francisco culture, mass arrests in L.A., the Diggers, the underground press in the UK and the US, the anti-war movement, the levitation of the Pentagon, pot and LSD, the influx of Eastern religions, psychedelic art and music, happenings, the Monterey Pop Festival, the San Francisco Be-in, and of course Sgt. Pepper. I've watched anything I could get ahold of about the 1960s (including the 6 hour PBS special \"Making Sense of the Sixties\") but nothing comes close to this film in capturing the range of ideas being explored at the time or the exhilaration of it. The film features many important participants of the times: Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, Abbie Hoffman, Paul Kantner, Peter Coyote, Ron Thelin, Barry Miles, Chet Helms, Allen Cohen, and so many others. The role of Sgt. Pepper was to put a small slice of the counterculture in the bedrooms of millions of kids around the world. It took the counterculture from a cult interest to a mainstream interest. If you haven't seen this film and you are a sixties buff, it is essential viewing. We have seen a few countercultures since this time, like the punk movement and the rave scene, but neither of those seem to have had the breadth or heart of the 1960s breakthroughs. I think this is why the 60s counterculture is a reference point for youth of each succeeding generation. \"It Was Twenty Years Ago Today\" is an excellent introduction to the 1960s and the Sgt.

So the ideas in the play are Shaw's, not Julius Caesar's, and that renders the finished product a bit difficult to assess, I suggest, without taking into account the structure of the play from which its screenplay was 'adapted\". as well as the historical context upon which it comments. The decision to make much of the play on soundstages was typical of the period, I assert, but does not always work to the finished product's advantage. However, anyone seeing the film for the first time would know it is an \"A\" production, and he or she would have to admit that the use of color is unusually rich and fine. The battle scenes are serviceable; the cast is extraordinary. Also, the finished product conveys Shaw's message very clearly--about avoiding extremes as a ruler, which is a necessary message to would-be rulers or even statesmen in any Age, especially our own at this time... The story begins with Julius Caesar, recent victor over his father-in-law Pompey the Great in a terrible Roman civil war arriving in Egypt in pursuit of the escaped opponent. He goes out alone by night to ponder his own mortality and worldly power, addressing his remarks to the aged monument The Great Sphinx. Cleopatra is listening there--he wonders if she is a divine child when he first meets her; and she calls him, \"old gentleman\", not recognizing him. The next day, he takes over the country, and meets the horrible Egyptian royal court. The girl has a nasty little brother, a bad adviser, a tough general and a murderous Nurse named Ftatateeta. he makes Cleopatra Queen, under him; his army holds the balance of power; and with his interesting staff, including a secretary Britannus, an old soldier named Rufio, and an aide named Lucius, he proceeds to be nearly assassinated and then to fight off an attack by the Egyptian army led by its fine general , Achillas. The remainder of the film consists in him trying to teach Cleopatra to be a queen and not a monster, and tell her why he is not doing terrible reprisals to every enemy.. He is only partly successful. The great Library of Alexandria has been burned during the battle, he is still in a somewhat precarious position, and she is bloodthirsty; her killing of Ftatateeta is justified but she enjoys it too much. By the time Caesar leaves, promising to send his friend Antony to console her for his absence, as he returns to Rome, we are in no doubt that Caesar's way would be best--and that Egypt for the Egyptians would be catastrophic. There is one rather spectacular scene as a hoist ascends to Caesar's level; and there is also the forming of a testudo or \"turtle\" formation with a roof of shields during the fire and the escape by leaping into the harbor by Caesar and others is well done. But overall, this is a play where human beings caught in a fascinating historical era's most-charged situation actually talk to one another. The screenplay by playwright Shaw is unusually literate for a film; and Gabriel Pascal's direction contributes to the overall dramatic movement even where physical movement may be wanting. Shaw and the director wring out many unusually fine nuances of character, attitude and reaction everywhere. The credits name Georges Auric as contributor of music, Oliver Messel as costume creator and credit Messel and John Bryan for the lovely art direction. Important cinematographers Jack Cardiff, Jack Hildyard, Robert Krasker   and Freddie Young  all received screen recognition as well. Among the actors, Vivien Leigh, then 32, portrayed a teenaged girl quite interestingly; she made a vivacious potential-monster, irresponsible-queen. Claude Rains works hard as Caesar but lacks a bit of vocal power to gain the credit for his intelligent try an extremely demanding part; he is very good, as is Stewart Granger as the by-contrast athletic young Apollodurs. Cecil Parker played Britannus the bookish slave, with Franics L. Sullivan as the wicked Pothinus, the young King's evil Svengali, Basil Syndey was a stout Rufio and Raymond Lovell and Anthony Eustrel were Lucis and Achillas respectively. Flora Robson deserved an award for her monstrous man-strangling Nurse. The remainder of the cast was filled with lesser knowns and soon-to-be-know performers such as Michael Rennie; Leo Genn; Alan Wheatley; Stanley Holloway; Esme Percy, Ronald Shiner, Renee Asherson, Jean Simmons, Kay Kendall, Valentine Dyall, Roger Moore Zena Marshall, Michael Cacoyannis, and Louis de Wohl. This feature film is perhaps not a great movie, but it was very- intelligently scripted, and it is still absorbing, physically stunning in many scenes and expensive without ever being overwhelmed by its own sets nor embarrassed by its historical re-creations.

Pay no attention; they know nothing about the lengthy history of superb French Action Films. The French actually produce some good movies from time to time. They are not all pretentious 'Arthouse' flicks which involve lots of shagging and boring dialogue. Jean-Pierre Jeunet gave us Delicatessen and 'The City of Lost Children' - he then made 'Alien:Resurrection' but we forgave him when he delivered 'Amelie'. Then there is Luc Besson who gave us 'Subway', 'Nikita' as a warm up then the fabulous 'Leon' ('The Professional' in the US) and the superb 'Fifth Element'. If you check the production companies involved on those last two you will find that they are entirely French, only US distributors were involved. Besson has sort-of disappeared from movie making for a while, concentrating on producing and writing cheapo European action films like 'The Transporter' and 'Taxi' 1&2 (not the lame US remakes). The reason for this lengthy preamble is to point out that not all French films are dull, and illustrate the fact that actually the French have a lot to teach a jaded Hollywood in how to make action movies. Which brings me to 'The Nest'. I watched John Carpenter's fantastic 'Assault on Precinct 13' when I was probably 15 and bored one evening. I didn't know anything about Carpenter, the film had no recognizable stars and I had no idea what was going to happen. Needless to say the film is excellent. It was the first time in my cinema going life that I felt not just wonder when watching a film, but also claustrophobia, oppression and genuine fear. 'The Nest' is a total remake of 'Assault'. It doesn't hang about (though its setup is maybe a little longer and a smidge wider-ranging than Assault's), introducing three groups of characters so quickly that you genuinely have no idea what they are up to. Sami Naceri, the star of the hugely daft Taxi films, is best known as a comic actor, yet plays successfully against type here (why isn't he a star on the same level as Jean Reno by now?)Pascal Greggory has the looks and presence of a hit-man, but is actually a security guard, Nadia Fares looks like a catwalk model, but utterly convinces as the military enforcer. The lesser characters (which isn't really fair as this is a purely ensemble piece of work) all inhabit their characters completely, their complex relationships spark off believable dialogue that never once slips into cliché. It is this commitment to reality that underlines 'The Nest' and makes it so successful. Almost the entire film takes place in a single warehouse, which is similar to 'Assault' except that Carpenter's film had a number of locations within the police house. The Nest has three areas - a Boiler room, a security desk that has a clear view over the entire warehouse, and the warehouse itself. Although this lessens the claustrophobia somewhat, it is hugely successful in putting all of our characters in peril at once. Another twist is that in 'Assault' the characters can retreat through to another room of the building. Early on in 'The Nest' it becomes clear that their only area of retreat has already been compromised by the enemy. The warehouse almost becomes a character itself, as the film becomes more and more desperate, the lights are removed and the shadows glower and threaten. Only bullet holes let in any more light, leaving shafts of light to taunt the stars with the hope they may get out of this alive. This realism (which isn't entirely there in the plot TBH), extends to wounds. A character is shot in the thigh early on in the film and spends the rest of the film limping painfully about. Other characters are injured throughout the events and stay injured, they don't suddenly find the ability to fire guns after being shot in the shoulder. This is gritty film-making and helps make 'The Nest' so successful. It feels real, you don't know what characters are going to make it or not. This leads to genuine tension. We may have seen the story before (wounded character stays behind to protect his friends; scared character finds the inner strength to confront the enemies head on), but its presentation here feels exciting and, if not exactly fresh, new. Another major lesson that Hollywood should learn from this film is the way it looks. There are some magic shots in here - a standout is an exact remake of Charlie Sheen's airlift from the Jungle in Platoon (!) - which not only looks great, and is genuinely unusual, but also adds greatly to our understanding of the character involved. 'The Nest' is not original, it is also not high art. It is an extremely solid action picture that is unusually exciting and tense. The director, Florent-Emilio Siri, conjures up desperation, hopelessness and genuine evil from his group of talented character actors as well as successfully re-creating Carpenter's feeling of an unstoppable army out to get them. The idea that the villains are insectile and swarming around outside highlighted by the low-light headgear they all wear is interesting and well illustrated. Siri got the gig directing Bruce Willis in 'Hostage', which is interesting as I would genuinely rate 'The Nest' alongside Willis' 'Die Hard' as examples of how to do an action movie well. It really is that good.","rw1134477","Assault on Precinct 13 - French Style","soxlade",0],[["5","5"],"The Magical World of Disney: Child of Glass (1978) Season 24, Episode 16","10","22 July 2005","I LOVED this movie.

Matool is shanghaied by a gun toting stranger looking for bedroom fodder for his swinger wife and her freak show sister. Naturally, Matool is eager to please. However, when a trio of wounded soldiers who have been ambushed by a new strain of hyper fast zombie show up at the house, the husband begins to wonder if there are too many roosters in the chicken coop. Tensions rise, zombies attack, alliances shift, but perhaps the ultimate factor is one that the audience has not even considered.The acting is good, especially the main characters, Matool, Nathan, and Mandel. Matool is a likable protagonist, along the lines of a Quentin Tarantino type, perhaps. The tension isn't unbearable, but the unique plot has the audience genuinely interested in what the heck is going on and how it will turn out. The fight scenes are well choreographed and fun, and the dialog is sensible and well spoken. These are not your standard cut and paste horror movie lines. The editing and camera-work are good, and the soundtrack is well matched to the scenes.

When Margaret winds up married to Henry, the former Mrs. Wilcox's will is finally carried out, but not without plenty of objection by Henry's spoiled children.At the same time Leonard Bast, a banker, has fallen on hard times. After taking bad advice from Henry, Leonard has been left in a low-paying job, believing that his previous place of employment is going out of business. Instead, the place booms. Margaret and her sister Helen, who set up Leonard to receive Henry's advice, feel responisble and Margaret demands that Henry give Leonard a job. Henry's refusal leads to great tension in the Wilcox household.Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson star in this Merchant-Ivory production. Their fantastic chemistry, later used to brilliant effect in \"Remains of the Day\", a Merchant-Ivory masterpiece, is evident throughout. Hopkins has a way of making even his posture pretentious and condescending. He bends at the waist, as if looking down on everyone, and his sense of overwhelming confidence makes him easily hateable. Emma Thompson is just the opposite. She is warm, welcoming, and open to everyone.It is when the two meet that things get really interesting. Thompson's Margaret is someone that Hopkins' Henry can not bring himself to look down upon, and his confidence breaks. The conversation in which Henry proposes perfectly shows Henry's true self: unconfident, bad with words, and afraid to be turned down.\"Howards End\" is a great film; a scathing critique of hypocrisy and classism, and at the same time a tale of a man who is too afraid to be himself, and a woman who refuses to be anything but herself.

These ideas are then highlighted by concert footage or an archived interview with the band shortly before the death of D. Boon.

Whether you are a fan of the Minuteman, or alternative rock in general, shouldn't matter in choosing this film. The story resonates around the childhood friendship between D.

Here, a rather more handsome Romaine Duris stars as Thomas, a real estate developer (a lower form of life than a loan shark in France, it seems) who also aspires to the concert platform, following in the footsteps of his late mother. Thomas meets by accident his mother's former manager who, remembering Thomas's talent as a child, suggests he audition. Thomas hires Miao Lin, a Chinese pianist studying at the Paris Conservatorium to show him how, though she speaks no French. In the meantime his chaotic life lurches on; he continues to evict tenants and squatters, do dirty deals, come to the aid of his aging and disorganized father, and help his partner to deceive the partner's wife.Yet strangely his playing improves until Miao Lin, a lady of very high standards, compliments his playing, and he fronts up for the audition to play a Bach Toccata and Fugue in Morris Minor, or whatever. It would be unfair to tell you the rest, but suffice to say it's not a fairy story, and Glenn Gould went mad trying to get the Toccata and Fugue right.Although this film has some of the elements of a thriller, as well as a rake's progress, it is essentially a character study of a fairly odd guy. Thomas has a curious relationship with his dissolute and not very charming father  their roles are almost reversed. He is contemptuous of women yet submits to Miao Lin's authority. He is not a nice person yet the viewer would like to see him climb out of the mire.Well, if the portrayal of real estate ethics in France is anything like the truth I sincerely hope I never have dealings with a French real estate agent.

House of 1000 Corpses is an absolute blast to watch, never wallowing in darkness and only really becoming a terror-ride toward the very end, meaning it's a movie that while not for all the family could well put a smile on at least some of their faces.The movies combination of gore-soaked serial-killer horror, Tim Burtonesque visuals and Evil Dead's sense of humour is a fresh turn from a genre currently stuck largely in bleak apartment buildings full of long-faced pouty heroines and even longer-faced pouty ghouls. Yeah it isn't that tense, but it's wickedly funny, wonderfully psychedelic and chock full of demented set-pieces. To be honest, I'd almost forgot what it was like to be entertained by horror before I watched this.A lot of people love to dissect this movie and venerate it's influences, but the bottom line is unlike Kill Bill which relied on you being as nerdy as Tarantino to enjoy it, Zombie's movie is fun whether or not you've seen the movies he doffs his threadbare circus hat to. It's a warped, psychedelic delve into mania that'll make you laugh out loud and keep you on the edge of your seat. Watch it. Watch it ASAP.","rw1134501","Can we get a hell yeah?

Not surprising that they are so hard considering they were first made for the arcade and it's a ploy by SNK for you to spend more money playing it. Now everything you loved about Metal Slug is on the Gameboy Advance, with a few new bonuses. One of them is the card system, which I cared not for, which you are awarded for rescuing certain prisoners or destroying certain bosses. Personally, I didn't think this changed the game much at all. Second is that you can save your progress in Metal Slug Advance, which will comes as a huge relief to anyone who's just defeated a near-impossible boss and doesn't think they'll be able to do so again. There are only five (very hard) levels in this game and you'll get through them in a week. Yes, at some points you'll want to hurl your GBA at the wall in frustration but stick at it and you'll learn certain patterns in which to get through the levels. And after you complete it you'll more than likely never play it again, no matter what cheap rubbish SNK have put in there to make you go through it again.

I could see this is a fine show about two real life actors like Dame Judi Dench and Michael Williams (who did receive a papal knighthood) playing two odd characters like a linguist and a landscaper. Judi plays Laura, the intellectual linguist, and Michael plays Mike, the quiet shy landscaper. At first, this is an unlikely pairing but you know if you know anything about the great Dame Judi Dench (even though she prefer you call her just Judi, no Dame Judi or Ms. Dench). This is their romance. While Dame Judi receives a lot of attention, Michael is the wind beneath her wings. I paid a lot more attention to his role in this show. I can see why she fell in love with him. When Judi asked about her longtime marriage to Michael, she responded that \"they just enjoyed being in the same room together.\" Now that is a sign of a fine romance and an excellent relationship. Michael never did receive the fame or accolades as his wife but I know he was proud of her even now as she earns one of Britain's top honor, Companion of Honor, only 65 living people at a time can receive this honor. When Dame Judi earned her O.B.E. (Officer of the British Empire) in 1970, Michael was not there in her life. When she became Dame Judi, Mike and her daughter, Finty was there at the palace. Now, she has her grandson, Sam, and Finty for this special occasion. I will say the writing of this show could be better. The humor is much dryer than normal, it is very cerebral and intellectual. Susan Penhaligon and Richard Warwick are just fine as Laura's sister Helen and brother-in-law Phil. It really is the story of Mike and Judi's great relationship. I bet you that Judi loved doing this show with Mike. It gave them a chance for both of them to shine.","rw1134504","A Fine Show!","Sylviastel",0],[["67","109"],"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)","10","25 July 2005","An alien probe is heading towards earth causing tidal waves and hurricane winds.

The label read EVIL DEAD II in a faded red typeface. Being English, I had no clue what to expect, I'd never heard of the original EVIL DEAD as it had been swept up in the BBFC's roundup of so-called \"Video Nasties\"(movies deemed likely by a short-sighted and infantile board of censors to \"deprave & corrupt\"). Either way, the weekend arrived, my house filled up with friends, the tape went in and we were changed forever.EVIL DEAD II a sequel to the original EVIL DEAD  the tragic tale of a group of teenagers assaulted by demonic forces while stranded in a remote cabin in the wilderness. EVIL DEAD II replayed the entirety of the first film (with several differences) in ten minutes, then brought more young folk out to the cabin to get generally mistreated by the demonic powers circling their cabin refuge like sharks at a shipwreck. Our hero is Ash, an average, slightly dumb guy who's out at the cabin with his girlfriend Linda. They find a tape recorder left by the previous tenant (a history professor working on the translation of an artefact he has discovered), and upon playing the tape release a demonic force into the woods around them. Linda gets possessed, Ash decapitates her with a shovel and then gets possessed himself (albeit temporarily). Plagued by demon-induced visions and a Linda that wont stay in buried, Ash descends into madness. Meanwhile four more victims arrive in the shape of the prof's daughter, a fellow colleague and a couple of local hicks out to make a quick buck. The circle is drawn, the demon's attacks build up in pace, and you just know it's all going to end in tears.EVIL DEAD II is like a ride on the best ghost train imaginable. It does not let up until the very end. Even the most ADHD-gripped teen can appreciate how balls-to-the-wall this movie is. Each gag is rapidly followed by another. I use the term \"gag\" as this movie, despite being filled with gore and violence, is funny. I mean fall on you ass laughing funny. Even when people are dying you have a malicious smile on your face. People get drenched in blood and goo, accidentally swallow eyeballs, get possessed and generally go mental, corpses are reanimated, trees come to life and attack and disembodied hands run amok. All the while the movie's tongue moves not an inch from its cheek. If you don't at least crack a smile at this film, you're probably dead already.Without a doubt though, this is Bruce Campbell's movie. As Ash he steals the show with bouts of world-class lunacy, crass cowardice, hammy scenery-chewing, physical comedy and occasional heroism. Ash is indeed a superhero in the making in this movie, soon after to become one of the greatest horror heroes ever. When he finally gets his act together to become the hero and dons his hero's \"armour\" I defy anyone not to think they're watching one of the coolest scenes in cinema history. Ash might be an idiot, but you'd want him at your six if demons were attacking your neighbourhood.The script is at times a bit limited and clunky, and some of the other performances are minimal. Also the effects sometimes look seriously bargain-basement. It doesn't matter in the slightest though. This is a film made with real passion, a sense of humour, and no desire to do anything that scare and delight the viewer. It's horror from a simpler age; one not afraid to be silly or gross in equal parts. It's classics like this that have cemented Sam Rami's career as a director to watch long before SPIDERMAN. EVIL DEAD II is without a doubt one of the greatest horror movies ever made. And if you've never seen it, there's only one thing you can do.

Another by the numbers horror film following the usual rules and ultimately leading to the usual, drab, gore-fest. How wrong I was! Off the back of a Mark Kermode review in The Observer I thought I would give it a crack - particularly as my girlfriend's a horror fan and I needed to redeem the genre after suffering her making me watch Creep. The plot is basic and borrows from numerous other horror films. Group of friends \"with issues\" get trapped in dark place with nasty things there out to get them. However, the way the material is realised on screen keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat, jumping repeatedly, however telegraphed the scares are, and cringing away from the fairly gruesome gore. One scene in particular when the group use the infra red setting on a camcorder to check everyone is OK had the entire cinema (including myself) screaming - an experience completely new to me and a real pleasure to endure. The pace is very cleverly set, with a slow, but never boring, build up of menace as the women's situation plummets from bad to downright hellish, before exploding in a finale that will leave you scared, breathless and absolutely terrified of the dark.

This movie, that I saw on Italian TV, and then more recently at Deepcon, uses exactly the opposite approach. No one and nothing is inherently terrifying. As a matter of fact the atmosphere exudes calm and reassurance. But when the notion underlying the story becomes clearer (I won't tell you what that is!) you realize you are walking on totally unfamiliar ground. Too bad these guys didn't have the resources to develop it into a long running movie. It would have been anxiety nonstop. When we dream the feeling of fear does not come from what we recall of the nightmare itself, but from the inexplicable sensation of anxiety as we wake up. The recollection is so fragmented, but the anguish is all there. I think this short interprets the phenomenon of night terrors very well, in a realistic way.

Now dear Indian they must have also got married.what does one do after marriage  but of course ! no points for that.they give birth to a baby !- the reason why people get married in the first place !  to make a woman complete!  she ..it seems is incomplete without the experience of a baby crying at midnight for milk or nappy change - anyways suffice to say that even their generation has grown  and probably they are the ones who indulge in all the things which cause general ruckus and unrest in the country  like  boozing, mid-night partying, womanizing  collecting wine, wealth and woman in their database  not bothering about anything else  just following the drain culture and copying the foreigners in every possible way.as taught to them by their forefathers ! Select few might not be so..the ones who used to be spies to the FF 4. Continuing with the circumstances which cause the Indian parents wed their daughters with foreign based men ..in spite of several told and untold miseries such marriages bring about !  Basically lack of knowledge and education and also probably lots of greed for money  which can buy one new expensive dresses and jewelry another set of necessities required to make a woman completeor look good enough in order to turn on the husband who will eventually part with his secretions (refer movie \"Look who is talking too\" title sequence - where the fertilization is shown in 3-d animation made the sperms look like devils traveling through the fallopian tube & later only one succeed in invading the wall of the ovum ) and give the greatest opportunity to a Woman  motherhood !..to be later kicked by them,as shown in Bagbaan Anyways story of Aa ab laut chalen  So the hero wants to make quick easy money  gets hooked on to a rich girl  who has shown a lot of her skin , cleavage etc.- who boozes and drinks  dances with other boys and treat him as dirt  but greed keeps him clinging to her.In the meanwhile Aishwarya (heroine) also lands up in foreign  she had also come to try her luck in marriage  the only vital reason of human birth, meets him and falls in love with him ! He turns her down as is has a better deal in hand  a rich, well endowed, beautiful , seductress looking woman for whom all men yearn ! Ash, in order to win his heart tries to look voluptuous and seductress by wearing skimpy outfits as suggested to her by Indian cab drivers, and others of their category, but it does not work ...she sings thusly: dear dear turn around your sight  your heart is here  where else are you looking ! its night there  its only here (with me) that's broad daylight) Heart broken she joins as a nurse to a multi billionaire who is Akshaya's (hero's) actual father actually  had humped his mother and later had settled down in foreign and was living happily ever after with wife and child. His mother , who was a pure, chaste, innocent & religious Indian woman kept the child  which she had conceived out of wedlock ( a momentary lapse had made her forget totally about chastity, purity, innocence and religion btw.).Suddenly father (Rajesh Khanna) sees a locket worn by Ash having the photo of both Akshaya's mother and himself ! He drowns in the entire ocean of fatherhood and gives away everything he had to the son born to him  once up on a time.Conclusion: Everyday is not a weekday for a son born out of wedlock ! The hero and the heroin meet and they live happily ever after  unless the voluptuous lady butts in again and become an \"eye sore\"-(Chokher Bali) to Ash this time !","rw1134525","Come on now , lets wind up and go home !","aparna-1",1],[["8","12"],"Star Wars: Revelations (2005 Video)","7","23 July 2005","The advent of readily available CGI technology now allows many people to produce, with some effort and some expense still, I might add films/ videos of the calibre of big budget films.The most interesting aspect, aside from the film itself (on which I shall comment further) is the question it raises about the huge amounts of finance that 'need' to be poured into Hollywood films. On the strength of this work by a relatively few dedicated people working for NOTHING and with a budget (insofar as I know) of AROUND $24000, the glaring disparity becomes clear, how much money is simply being poured down the toilet? how many millions? where is it all going? can actors still be justified in receiving pay packages of millions per film? No, not really, and a production such as this one will make people more aware of this fact. So well done for that.To the film- Bad points: Cheesy props ( the holocron), some awful attempts at voice impressions ( the emperor )- when will people learn that an American cannot dub the voice of an Englishman?! Especially with villains such as grand moff tarkin, count dooku and any sith with the exception of Darth vader , but then again James earl jones accent is very correct anyway and the voice is distorted.

I guess my gripes with it, is I think they over do it with comedy. I think they kind of stretch the humor too much. Some of it is funny though. Like when Corina says: \"You Want to break some more China?\" b/c Ichigo/\"Zoey\" broke all those dishes.

The low-cut from the Manga is gone, but I think that's in both versions, judging by looking up picks. However the costume design is fantastic. And I haven't people I've heard already. Well, I heard Rachel Lillis (Pokemon) in one Episode, but she was an extra guest star. So over all this series is good. One of the more better. At least didn't give Yugi's voice (Dan Green) to \"Mark\" as he is called. Another gripe is, I just wish they didn't pick the name Zoey for Ichigo. I think the names are suitable. I find the Manga/Anime names, to be a tad bit ridiculous. (Except for Ichigo) Lettuce, Pudding, Mint, are these girls or are they food? Even though Ichigo's name does mean \"strawberry\" That doesn't bug me. They don't really try to hide Japanese culture too much. They haven't changed Kendo, or anything to that sort.

Tries her level best to raise her daughter in best possible ways  giving her the basic necessities, educating her, providing her food and wants to keep her away from obscenities, cheapness and vulgarity etc. It's a movie of the 19th century , so now you can well understand how difficult it is for parents to give their child a healthy environment.Now what makes an environment  Neighbors, newspapers, magazines, TV, Internetschool friends etc. is'nt it ? yes it is.Few turning points of a girl named carrie : 1. at the age of 7, she asks a shameless nude woman lying nude in the garden what her breasts were all about ! Now S L U T woman are the kinds who can lie like that in front of public to watch  no mother  a righteous one  can ever stand her daughter being exposed to such vile women  so she beat her up  the poor lil' carrie ynderstood nothing. Mother thought that she is just doing the right thing.2. Mother never told daughter about Chums (periods, Menstrual cycle  which the girls now-a-days are seen celebrating in the TV advertisements)! it comes to her as a surprise in school  other class mates make fun of her  except one girl (very attractive African girl with sparkling eyes  I really liked her eyes  do not know her name). Later of course all the girls are given a dose of a lifetime by the Instructress and she throws Tampons at them  to teach the girls a lesson  The Instructress was also very attractive to look atI like such chiseled facial features .3. The good friend of Carrie requests her boyfriend to ask Carrie for a date to the College fest PAM .or something. He agrees and asks Carrie out. Carrie who had read in magazines and in fairy tales since her childhood about Prince Charming coming and etc. was very happy.4. In the meanwhile Carrie had learnt Telekinesis ( Mind Control and contacting the subtle world) through the Internet  since she was alone and hardly had any friends and other stupidities like partying, picnicking, gossiping etc. she could concentrate and even succeed in receiving the services of the Subtle world.5. She tailors a dress for herself  a plunging neckline- revealing her cleavage and shoulders  to her mother's horror  her mother could not stop her as she had come to know of Carrie's super natural powers.and was rather afraid of her. She tries to tell her of some 13th chapter in Bible (I have not read the Bible in so much detail actually  sorry!) - where it has been stated that women who seduce and wear such vulgar outfits burn in hell for eons !- but Carrie does not listen.6. In the mean while the other students  of idiot and sick parents , decide to drench Carrie in Pig's blood ! and by cheating, makes her win the dance contest she is invited on the stage to be given the award (my heart cried for her as I knew that soon she will be drenched in blood !)  and her happiest moment becomes the saddest moment for her .not because of God but because of children belonging to parents who are greedy, sick, jealous, vamp-ish and villain-aceous IDIOTS.7. Anyways  in order to give a lesson of a life time  the Higher Subtle Level  blocks the hall doors and many of them die - suffocated within the walls  short circuit happens  many students ..who were not even aware of what some miscreants had done  were burnt to death ! (quite like burning in hell.most girls actually wore revealing outfits by the way) they all die because of the mistake of a few (4-5 of them) Idiot-rabid-street-dog born sons and daughters ! 8. Back home , her mother sees her all smitten in blood and concludes that Carrie, after all paid for her disobedience and wearing that kind of outfit enraged the Gods and is thus fit to be killed ! She tries to drown her in the bath tub  but since Carrie had access to super natural powers by now, kills her Mother instead.9. The Director therefore has tried to teach the world that  for supporting truth, purity and innocence, the Higher powers can finish, annihilate the entire world order.as it happened in Ramayana and Mahabharata, Sir Mosses broke the two slabs of 10 Commandments (the first time) on seeing the people, he had taken the risk for, dancing like pigs with nude women, cheap wine & black wealth ! 10.

However, the 2 main characters here, despite fitting the standard Trekker profile of letting Trek dominate their lives, are well-rounded in other aspects: one of 'em, despite never having any money and a loser sensibility, is pretty successful with girls & doesn't have problems 'getting some.' The other is successful career-wise, with normal interests, as well. The filmmakers obviously wanted to show Trekkers as more than just weird geeks. However, something doesn't jibe with this presentation: the 2 guys come across as SO normal, it's hard to believe they've got every Trek episode memorized. That being said, this flic is a Trekker dream, filled with pop cultural references (for other Sci-Fi famous flics,too) and in-jokes that will probably baffle those not informed about Trek sayings & terminology (one scene is even filmed at a famous site from one of the classic episodes, but this was already done in \"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey\"/1991). In the plot, the 2 guys, who both work in the film industry in L.A., happen to spot their idol, William Shatner, in a bookstore (Shatner, who portrayed Capt.Kirk in the classic Trek series and movies, is played by ...William Shatner). He doesn't live up to their expectations of a hero, even coming across as a bit of a loon, setting the stage for the re-evaluation of their lives. In all, the movie comes across as a bit silly and even pointless, with non-too-subtle moralizing about what's important in life, and apparent low-budget origins. But even non-Trekkers should find it mildly amusing. The DVD even has explanations of all the arcane Trek references, including optional subtitles.

I was expecting a decent science fiction movie, instead I got a hacked up attempt at a sci-fi action/romance combination, with too many large nitpicks that it spoiled the experience.The story is pretty straight forward. A group of people live in isolation after being told that they are the survivors of some global catastrophe. They a mundane, but secure and physically fit life with promises that they will one day go to The Island, the last Utopian location on the planet. The main character, Lincoln-6-Echo, discovers the horrible truth; the people are in some kind of prison and everything they've been told is a lie. Eventually he escapes with Jordan-2-Delta and they discover that they are really clones of people in the \"real world\" that use the clones for body parts. They escape are on the run, then eventually return to free the other clones.The movie overall was good, it just had too many plot problem that just nagged on me enough to spoil the movie in general:1) The 2 fugitives escape from the compound with relative ease. Where is the security? How come they are able to walk down a long access bridge to freedom with NO ONE spotting them? They already fought security guards; no one is able to keep tabs on their position? 2) The main characters supposedly have the education of 15 year olds and they supposedly have almost NO knowledge of the \"real world\". Yet once they get to a train station and then to Los Angeles, they don't seem to have any problems getting around. I mean, they act stupid and don't know phrases like \"the can\", \"taking a dump\", \"dude\" and act incredulous around this. Yet they don't seem to have a problem navigating around a metropolis, which to them would be an alien environment. 3) The main characters get by with 5 movies worth of luck. They dodge trained military personnel. Survive drops from a skyscraper hundreds of feet in the air and manage to take out a helicopter while doing so. They are in a car when it gets totaled (cut in half!!) after getting side-swiped by an armored truck and walk away, not even dazed. I found it hard to empathize with the characters when they were in \"danger\" because they seemed to be invulnerable! 4) Clones with memories. This is a pet peeve of mine. Memories are NOT a part of a creatures DNA structure. A clone is simply a copy of a creatures physical make up. It cannot have the experience and memories of its donor, because the clone itself hasn't had those experiences or memories. Yet movies frequently portray a clone as not only having the same physical properties as a donor, but the same memories as well. Although, in this movie, the memories were mostly \"subconscious\". 5) When Jordan was brought back to the institution towards the end, NO ONE thought to search her for a weapon?!! 6) During some of the big action scenes (fighting with the guards while escaping and the big highway chase scene with the flying attack bikes) the camera kept shaking and it was hard to see what the heck was going on. Whats the point of seeing a movie, when the movie *itself* makes it difficult to see what is on the screen?!As the movie went on, these issues just keep accumulating until by the end, I just wanted to see the end.As a side note, I noticed that this movie was almost identical to merging together two other movies: Logans Run and Freejack. The movie has a man and a woman on the run, leaving an isolated society and encountering the world outside, only to return and \"free\" the people from the society (Logans Run). Meanwhile, they are on the run and hunted down by mercenaries, because their bodies are actually owned by some rich person (Freejack).Overall, I give the movie a 4 out of 10. I would give the movie a 7 out of 10 for just the story, but this is reduced for the annoying issues I mentioned previously.","rw1134538","Decent movie spoiled by glaring nitpicks","MadWatch",1],[["31","64"],"Missing in Action (1984)","2","25 July 2005","Hilarious!

It was a period of ufanistic productions where one hero could destroy anything that threats America or its ideal of freedom. Films like Rambo II, Red Dawn, Commando or Rocky IV looked seen to be wrote by someone at Reagan's office, but at least they had some qualities. This Braddock had none. Chuck Norris leads the scariest cast of all times (M Emmet Walsh should be punished to do a film like that - how come he had done Blood Simple later?). The screenplay does not make any sense (Braddock kills a character vital to the story  a big shot Vietnam general  and there are no consequences), the action scenes are primary (the sequence with the boat  that should be the climax! - seems to be shot by high school students), the cinematography is awful (mixing up sequences on a bright day and others made on a numb one).

I cried for about two hours straight after wards. It had never previously occurred to me how people, in war time, could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. We see several examples of this here - in both the scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home. I was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind. However, I am glad I watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own. The blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since I saw the film. His horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me. At one point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason,it only occurred to me afterward that I'd only be hitting a big screen - that shows the film's power and intensity at least).

Theirs is a tiny, tumbledown, drafty old house but it is filled with love. Every night, the last thing Charlie sees from his window is the great factory, and he drifts off to sleep dreaming about what might be inside.For nearly fifteen years, no one has seen a single worker going in or coming out of the factory, or caught a glimpse of Willy Wonka himself, yet, mysteriously, great quantities of chocolate are still being made and shipped to shops all over the world.One day Willy Wonka makes an announcement. He will open his famous factory and reveal \"all of its secrets and magic\" to five lucky children who find golden tickets hidden inside five randomly selected Wonka chocolate bars. Of course, Charlie finds one of the tickets, and the surprises awaiting him within the factory give Charlie a certain glow inside.Tim Burton has done it again.This 'Charlie' is a considerable improvement on the film it remakes, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'.

Sadly Nolan fails in the action department, and this lets the whole film down for me.

Talbot is excellent and carries the show. Notable performances are given by Pernell Pratt as the police detective and Harvey Clark as the janitor.

There is a scene at the end that has gruesome implications but is not gratuitous and therefore adds to the depth of the story. One gaff I noticed: about 5 minutes into the picture Rogers is talking to the detective. She is smoking a cigarette (there's a lot of smoking going on through out the film) and he is smoking a cigar. While holding the smoking butt she leaves the room only to enter another room sans cigarette. It is very interesting to see the styles of dress and automobiles of the times.

It should be life affirming or even, at its best, life changing. But this is dreck, drivel and dross and utterly meritless.You can see how the director's thought processes were working - 'I like indie music. I like sex. I'l make a film about both and get some schmuck to finance it.' More like an extended short with no narrative and very little dialogue the film is summed up thus: the two leads go to rock concerts, shag then do the same again. And again. And again. That's it. People don't actually do anything or say anything much except a few mumblings here and there that is supposed to pass for conversation and communication. There's some attempt at an explanatory thread going on with a bizarre metaphor about Antarctica and how relationships are claustrophobic and agoraphobic at the same time.Thinking it has something profound to say about the human condition, this film is pretentious, self indulgent and self absorbed which, like the music, is all style and no substance - a film of such epic pseudo- intellectual proportions, it disappears up its own arse (surprisngly, one of the few sexual acts not appearing in the film).God knows what the actors thought they were getting themselves into, and I'm sure everyone went into it with their eyes wide open, but the whole thing just comes across as exploitive.

Instead he plays a boorish and unintelligent Tom Cruise. No panache, no style. Not enough attention is payed to Miranda Otto, who was so riveting in \"The Two Towers\" and \"The Return of the King\". The kids are irritation personified. It's as if Spielberg wanted to show the world how an invasion affected a stereotype of the common family. If this is the common family, we're in trouble. A father who doesn't deliver the necessary skills to his children, or give them expectations to achieve; kids who don't pay attention to authority figures; a crazy Tim Robbins whose character's actions, and final outcome, are pointless to moving us through the story. There wasn't enough horror in this flick. Here we have a filmmaker who has redefined what can be done with film, i.e \"Jaws\" and \"Schindler's List\", who has a chance to do it yet again with a classic story of alien invasion, to truly scare us and make us think, and instead, we get tripe. No spoiling here unless I'm not opaque enough, but there is such a cop out, a deus ex machina, in the end of the movie that my impression was that Spielberg mistakenly assumed that the movie was horrific enough for the viewer to that point.

It actually serves as a notable turning point as it is the first in a string of Technicolor melodramas Sirk helmed at Universal-International, as well as one of his most popular. It also kick-started the malnourished career of Rock Hudson and sent his fame into another realm. Despite the film's lame-brained premise and endless implausibilities, Sirk takes the material and dishes out a sweet, moving drama that is a thinly disguised tale of Christianity.Hudson stars as Bob Merrick, a millionaire playboy with no cares in the world. His lavish and self-serving lifestyle inadvertently leads to the death of a prominent local doctor, Wayne Phillips. Dr.Phillip's widow, Helen(Jane Wyman)tries to pick up the pieces of her shattered life, while at the same time resisting the advances of Bob Merrick. His persistence results in an accident in which Helen goes blind. In a convoluted and corny twist, Bob tries to redeem himself by giving selflessly to others and devoting his life to medicine to find a way to restore Helen's eyesight.Every stereotype of every soap opera convention is used in overwhelming doses to tell the story of \"Magnificent Obsession\". The \"alternative lifestyle\" of Christianity that Bob learns is a mish-mash of psychobabble that even the most detail-oriented viewer would find boring and confusing. And the seriousness in which the actors take the material is eye-rollingly unbelievable. But this film is saved by the always-savvy direction of Douglas Sirk(who himself hated the plot)and an elegant, understated Jane Wyman who brought her own brand of sophistication to every role she played - and was Oscar-nominated for this role. Even Hudson is able to overcome his nerves in his first leading, A-list role to give a performance that is convincing. Sirk's use of reflective surfaces and a dominating color palette give this movie a look that is undeniably sheen. And Frank Skinner's classical score takes the ordinary material to an emotional level; although the choral \"oohs and aahs\" on the soundtrack are a bit pungent for such a quiet film. This is not Sirk's best work, but it is definitely solid enough to engage first time viewers and a must for fans of the German-bred director's work.","rw1134570","The Glossy Facade Gives Way To A Studio Classic","Michael27-1",0],[["30","38"],"Unfaithfully Yours (1948)","10","23 July 2005","Though he directed a few more movies over the years, Unfaithfully Yours was the last great hurrah from one of Hollywood's greatest comedy writer-directors, Preston Sturges. But Lawdy, what a way to go out.The movie stars Rex Harrison in what might be seen as a kinder, gentler cousin of his egomaniacal diction professor in My Fair Lady (1964). Here, Harrison is Sir Alfred de Carter, a world-renowned symphony conductor who is still astoundingly infatuated with the woman he refers to as his \"bride,\" Daphne (charming Linda Darnell). The movie never declares how long or short of a time the Carters have been married, but judging from their passion level, one would guess they're still in the honeymooning stage.(The far more down-to-earth married couple, Alfred's in-laws August and Barbara, are portrayed wonderfully by Rudy Vallee and Barbara Lawrence. Barbara gets all the great barbs off against her husband, who is only to happy to show his ignorance of them.) One day, August accosts Alfred with the unfortunate news that he paid a detective to tail Daphne while Alfred was out of town. Alfred is so convinced of his wife's fidelity that his reaction starts at outrage and goes haywire from there. Little by little, though, Alfred is given reason to think that Daphne might have needed some spying-on after all. At his concert that evening, Alfred conducts three pieces by Rossini, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner, and with each piece, Alfred imagines the stylish revenge he will extract upon Daphne for her presumed cheating.From this sober-sounding scenario, Sturges--as he always did--goes all over the place, from sparkling dialogue to skittering slapstick to rich drenches of sentiment. And the melange has never worked better than it does here. Just for kicks, take three of the movie's set-pieces: Alfred's achingly funny dressing-down of August for siccing a detective on Daphne, the first fantasy where Alfred hatches an elaborate murder scheme, and Alfred's drunken attempt to carry out the scheme. Three scenes of complete different tones, and they all plausibly fit into the same movie. Now try to imagine any modern-day comedy-maker whose work would display the wit of any of those scenes.The Criterion Collection DVD of the movie does it full justice. It includes a seemingly irrelevant but nonetheless enjoyable critique of Sturges' work from Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones. And an interview with Sturges' widow Sandy, as well as copies of voluminous memoes to Sturges from uncredited producer Darryl Zanuck, demonstrate why the movie was initially a colossal box-office failure. Zanuck hounded Sturges to the point that the gifted creator of (to name but two) The Palm Beach Story and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek began doubting himself as a writer, resulting in the final humiliation of Zanuck cutting the film on his own. Then a timely scandal involving Rex Harrison forever killed the box-office chances of a black comedy starring Harrison as an ostensible woman-murderer.Happily, Unfaithfully Yours, like Chaplin's similarly dark Monsieur Verdoux, survived its prudish times and has become renowned as a great movie. Alfred's take on Delius might be delirious (as professed by one of his fans, played by the great Sturges alumnus Edgar Kennedy)...but Sturges himself remains stupendous.","rw1134571","A great symphony of a comedy","steve-bailey-1",0],[["0","1"],"Universal Soldier: The Return (1999)","3","23 July 2005","This is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller.

In this one, it's, I guess, about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter about that age. Now he's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site super-computer (named Seth - like the snake in \"King Cobra\" the same year) goes power-crazy, takes command of the Unisols, and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We're lookin' at the next step in evolution, folks! Most of Van Damme's fights are with one particularly mean Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps on comin': drop him off a building - no good; run him down with a truck - no go! Shoot him, burn him - forgetaboutit! Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out-classed(he's even going grey around the edges). But, though he takes a lickin', he keeps on kickin'! Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals, and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius, it manages to be consistently entertaining, especially if you're a pro-wrestling fan.","rw1134572","concept & Van Damme getting old","Bogmeister",0],[["2","5"],"Hellraiser: Deader (2005 Video)","1","24 July 2005","Rick Bota had me expecting the best from Hellraiser:Deader when I saw hellseeker.

It's got a whole different feel. It almost can survive on it's own without Pinhead. Worst part of the film is that it quotes a line from a previous installment that was filmed beautifully and they make it meaningless and somewhat comical. Can't pinhead at least have a new line by part 7? I'm disappointed. I hope hellworld, the next installment, will have cenobites and Pinhead and make sense.In short... no more words needed. Deader is not a hellraiser film, the title is stupid, the story was obviously changed and there was a character that was supposed to be evil that they decided to not associate with Pinhead but, rather than rework the film completely they left the traces so you can figure it out.

Street-fighting between Communists and reactionaries is chronicled, explicating the German populace's understandable desire for law and order.Local operation of the Gestapo, the surprisingly low count of actual employees and the extent to which surveillance by neighbors led to non-conformant citizens' denunciation and imprisonment is illustrated through a brief look at a case in Nürnberg. The informant who sent her innocent neighbor to die in a camp is interviewed.The Wild East chapter illustrates the great variance in regional Nazi commanders' approach to Germanization of Poland and how Hitler's management style facilitated bureaucratic fiefdoms.Too often documentaries demonize the Nazis and assume individuals somehow sprang fully formed from the gates of hell. In contrast, each of the well-crafted installments of The Nazis: A Warning from History offers new insight into the development and functioning of the Nazi state and enables us to intelligently consider the lives of its supporters.

I first saw it as a kid on late night TV around 1970 and it did scare the *bleep* outta me. The most lasting image is the monster grabbing one of the hapless humans and killing him with a flurry of monstrous swipes; I knew from a statement in a previous scene that every bone in this guy's body had just been broken. The film did a good job of setting up all the characters, as each was distinguishable, and you begin to fear for each individual, not just a faceless group. The creature itself was the stuff of every 10-year old's nightmare, an indestructible freakazoid which would have another Creature (from the Black Lagoon) for lunch easily. Adults, of course, pass it off as a man in a suit, but I think most of these tough guys, if they ran into this thing in the dark, would not be looking for a zipper - they'd be trying to scale an unclimbable wall. The setting for this type of scare flic is brilliant: a haunted house in outer space, with no place to go (well, according to this, you can leave temporarily if you have a spacesuit). The template for this was later used in Alien(79), but I always felt the ship in that film was TOO Big; there would always be, it seemed, some nook or cranny for Ripley to hide in and she blew up that ship prematurely. Here, the crew runs out of room quickly; there's nothing left to do in the end except wait a few more minutes for the big ugly monster to kill you. The claustrophobic atmosphere and the sense of 'no place to go, no place to hide' were palpable. I'll mention one more thing, there was a long period after I first viewed this that I had no desire to go to Mars.","rw1134578","Dig that crazy alien monster","Bogmeister",0],[["0","0"],"Tombstone (1993)","9","25 July 2005","Oh, yeah.

As a matter of fact, even Wyatt's seeking the love of his life seems just to be the legitimate expression of his love for Doc. Val Kilmer's Doc is Bob Dylan finally showing up in the Old West -- ironic, laconic, fragile, and lovable...and just too cool for words.

Simply put, this TV version is a Navy garbage scow filled to overflowing with every manner of rotting refuse.Everything about this production stinks to the high heavens. The inexplicably rewritten and mangled script makes little sense from one scene to the next, much less as a whole. There is no magic, no romance, no wartime nostalgia, no, well, writing. The magnificent score, arguably Broadway's greatest, is watered down to near-Muzak levels, and is at times barely recognizable.Glen Close is a fine singer, but does little of interest with a lapful of jewels. The other principals appear apologetic for forcing people to put up with their singing IN A MUSICAL.The only bright spots were when the chorus, both the sailors and the nurses, sang. They had little worthwhile to do, but, boy, could they sing! I suspect the choral numbers were recorded by professional singers and lip-synched by the actors since the sound, particularly the soloists, was most unlike what one hears onstage anymore.If this had opened on Broadway in 1949, it would have died a quick and painful death within a week, and SOUTH PACIFIC would have been lost to the ages. And this abominable remake is equal to the other ABC/Disney tragedies of recent years--ANNIE, Cinderella and particularly THE MUSIC MAN, the second worst offender of the lot.

I never found myself sympathizing with the main characters, but I still thought that they were (for the most part) well performed.But that's about it for what was good about this movie. I'm not even going to touch the blatant Jaws rip-off at the alligator farm. The primary antagonist was Flat Dog, a gigantic crocodile (and when I say gigantic, I mean think she was actually a prehistoric crocodile, rather than a Nile crocodile as the movie claimed) who apparently had the ability to jump like a dolphin and charge like a rhinoceros. Some bozos smash her eggs, so she gets angry and goes on a killing spree. I never thought I'd say this about a horror movie, but I think I preferred the CGI croc (used whenever we saw her in her entirety) over the animatronic (used when we only saw her head). That's not to say the CGI was particularly realistic, however. Flat Dog wouldn't have looked out of place in an episode of Animal Face-Off (if you've ever seen the show, you'll know what I mean).I won't go into any depth about any of the characters' deaths, but the first major one to die is counter-intuitive to everything horror deaths should be (not to mention what actually happens if you're attacked by a crocodile). To be scary, a death needs to be painful and drawn-out. As the guy who created Leatherface, Tobe Hooper should've known this.This movie tried so hard to be Jaws.

The fact about where she ends up is clear from the outset as we see her frozen body lying in a ditch and the film attempts to piece together what brought her to her sad ending.18-year-old Mona Bergeron (Sandrine Bonnaire) is infuriating and largely unlikable, but the film does not judge her actions or lifestyle and Varda offers no explanations, psychological insights, or admonitions to society, there is just Mona - a spunky but deeply troubled young woman. On the surface she is a free spirit. She smokes a lot of cigarettes and pot, drinks cheap booze, and enjoys the company of men, but it is clear that there is a lot going on beneath - some untold story, perhaps a rejection from a member of her family or a boyfriend, an event that has instilled confusion and self-loathing, but we never find out. Like Charles in Bresson's The Devil Probably, Mona turns her anger inward without recognizing a problem, much less attempting to find its source and the film becomes one long suicide watch.Little by little we find out bits and pieces of information about Mona through interviews and recreated flashbacks but they do not add up to much. We learn that she comes from a middle class family, she has employable skills but there is no answer as to why she has dropped out of life, tuning out everything and everyone except the open road. Angry and self-righteous yet strangely passive, Mona drifts from one encounter to another without connection, commitment, or joy. She meets a college professor, a tree agronomist looking into the diseases that kill plants, a Turkish migrant worker who wants her to stay until his fellow workers reject the idea, a goat-herding intellectual who offers her a piece of land to cultivate, and a wealthy old woman who needs a companion.The reactions of the participants help us to create a picture but we learn more about the witnesses than about Mona. Each person reacts to her in a different way, and some romanticize her out of all proportion to reality. A young girl helps her fill her water bottle at the farm and later tells her parents that she wants to be free like that girl. Yolande, the maid at the old woman's estate, feels that Mona's relationship with a fellow drifter is her idea of true love. Some offer her a way out but she will have none of it. She prefers the road with its adventure and uncertainty. The farmer disappointedly says: \"It's not wandering, it's withering.\" One of the best scenes is when she gets drunk with the old woman who knows everyone is waiting for her to die. Both have a moment of laughter but it is only a mask for world-weariness and will not hold off the night, encroaching like a thief. In a truly accomplished performance, Ms. Bonnaire creates a memorable character that forces us to bear witness to our own humanity. As one powerful moment blends into another, she forces us to see a face behind the statistics we see each day in the newspaper and to look this woman in the eye knowing that she is a part of us, perhaps the part that we would rather not see. Mona is not a person I would particularly care to meet, but I also know that she is one that I cannot ignore or ever forget.","rw1134583","Forces us to bear witness to our own humanity","howard.schumann",1],[["1","5"],"Cube (1997)","1","25 July 2005","The idea of this movie was fantastic.

Divided into ten segments plus a prologue and epilogue, the title is derived from a minuet-like dance for two people commonly performed at court during the 17th and 18th centuries. Like the dance, there are never more than two people on screen at any one time and the film is almost all conversation with bits of classical music. The film is vintage Bergman with revealing close-ups, emotionally intense dialogue, an old-fashioned style of film-making, and a surfeit of bitterness about the human condition.Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson, the original screen couple from Bergman's 1973 film Scenes of a Marriage, reunite in his summer home for their first face to face contact since their breakup. Johan has become very wealthy as a result of an inheritance. Marianne is a lawyer and they have two daughters from their failed marriage: Sara who is married to a prominent lawyer and lives in Australia and Martha who is in a mental institution and does not recognize her mother. Johan is surprised by his ex-wife's visit but they still hold hands and try to remember the good things about the past, though Johan's interest seems to be minimal. Living nearby are Henrik (Borje Ahlstedt), Johan's son from a second marriage and his daughter Karin (Julia Dufvenius), a promising young cellist. Henrik and Karin have an uncomfortably strong attachment and mutual need as a result of the recent death of Anna, Henrik's wife who was deeply loved.Henrik is training his daughter in the cello to prepare her for an audition at the local conservatory but has to turn to Johan for financial support who uses the occasion to humiliate him. Karin is contemplating going to Europe to work for an orchestra but is afraid of the consequences for Henrik if she leaves. Relationships between the family are strained, seemingly beyond repair and their world is filled with childish resentments and regrets. Karin resents her father for suffocating her emotionally. Marianne still resents Johan for his unfaithfulness. Henrik resents his father for -- not being a father. Johan resents Henrik for not being the son he wanted. No one can see beyond their ego to feel the needs and wants of others. The emotional pain is real but I found the end result to be facile and unconvincing.Saraband has received high praise as a \"lacerating examination of life's conundrums that is exhilarating in its fearlessness and its command\", and an \"affective, touching, and ultimately highly affirming picture of familial turmoil and the curative, as well as destructive, powers of love.\" But what I ask is this - What new insights do we gain about the human condition from witnessing a family go at each other with unbridled ruthlessness? In offering his audience the latest generation of \"emotional illiterates\", Bergman lets us see the clawing and fighting but hides the life-affirming reality that people are capable of transcending their limitations.In Saraband, there is no self- reflection, responsibility, or hint that people can change with the passage of time. His characters only seem to have been able to refine their capacity for collecting grievances. When Henrik is suffering, no one talks about him, goes to visit him, or seems in the least concerned. Is this the way Bergman after all these years sees human relationships? Is this the legacy he wants to leave us? Despite its considerable strengths, Sourband (sic) is a bitter and despairing film that left a bad taste in my mouth.","rw1134591","A bitter and despairing film","howard.schumann",0],[["1","2"],"Dark Water (2005)","4","25 July 2005","\"Dark Waters\" was disappointing to say the least.

Hollywood can't seem to make a good scary movie any more. And the ending line was comical and several of us in the theatre actually laughed at the ludicrous statement made by Jennifer Connelly's character (I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie yet by explaining the last scene).Speaking of Hollywood, what is it with the cookie-cutter movies? It's always the same: ghost of a child talks/threatens the living child/family in the story and the adults walk around not knowing what is going on until the end when the body or the truth is found out.

The film has some strong moments, particularly in the last half-hour, but is undone by amateurish acting, exaggerated sentimentality, and the banal songs of British folk singer Donovan. Francesco is the son of a wealthy textile merchant. He has indulged in the good life in his youth but when he comes back seriously ill from fighting a local war his attitude towards life changes. He loves watching the birds, communing with nature, washing lepers, and helping the poor. He hears the message from the cross of a church that has been destroyed to \"go and rebuild my church\". Turning from his father's greedy ways, he renounces all his possessions and follows his ideal of Christ to live in simplicity and poverty. After one of his followers is killed, however, he goes to Rome to find out what he is doing wrong and, after much hesitation, receives the blessing of Pope Innocent III who is played by Alec Guinness in the only scene in the film that has any real emotional depth. Graham Faulkner is unconvincing as Francesco, playing the would-be saint with all the gob stopping goodness and wide-eyed conviction of Martin Short performing a routine on Saturday Night Live. He is not helped much either by Judi Bowker as Clare, a young disciple who joins Francesco in running through the flowers or by Lee Montague in an hysterically overwrought performance as Francis' capitalist father. Zeffirelli depicts the young St. Francis as a stereotypical hippie rebelling against the sins of greed and materialism. Of course by the time of the film, the hippie movement had turned into a sordid scene of drugs and violence and the idealism of the flower children had largely been preempted by a voracious media that inevitably responds to new ideas with the position that if you can't beat 'em, embrace and emasculate them. I cannot argue with the need to return to a life of authenticity, a life of the spirit, but despite all its surface promotion of an open lifestyle, the film is a barely disguised attempt to bring all the unwashed hippies into the Christian fold. Nonetheless, Brother Sun, Sister Moon is a beautiful looking film that might have still worked if the director had simply followed the teachings of his protagonist and shown less ostentation and earnestness, more naturalism and simplicity, and more appreciation than exploitation.","rw1134596","Exaggerated sentimentality","howard.schumann",0],[["1","1"],"I alepou kai o boufos (1987–1988)","7","25 July 2005","Giorgos Konstadinou is a living legend of Greek TV.He made lots of TV-series and he was pioneer in comedy in Greek TV.I alepou kai o boufos was one of his best!It was very funny and maybe cult!Giorgos Konstadinou holds the major role and has for leading lady the beautiful young blond girl Tzovanna Fragouli.The chemistry between them is unique.That's why they cooperate again and again in the future.Dina Konsta and Kostas Palios are very good but the character that plays Markos Lezes is really cult!Markos Lezes is in his major role in his poor career in the TV.He is very funny.It is pity that Giorgos Konstadinou don't make any more good TV-series.","rw1134597","Classical Giorgos Konstadinou","anstamatopoulos",0],[["3","4"],"Lord Zedd's Monster Heads: The Greatest Villains of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (1995 Video)","2","25 July 2005","Well, this is an odd one.

After the more than slight letdown of CORPSES, I wasn't expecting to be blown away by REJECTS, I was just looking to be entertained. Now mind you I've had a mini poster for this film hanging in my office for weeks, I've been talking about the film with friends, and we all pretty much agreed that based on the trailer it looked like Rob had finally gotten his chops down(basically, I really wanted to like this picture). Having said all this, about half way through finally watching the picture, I looked over at my wife and told her that I was considering walking out on the film, something I never do. I didn't walk out, and I'm glad that I stayed because there were some parts towards the end that I thought were pretty well executed, but overall my general attitude towards the film was that I pretty much was embarrassed for Rob.The violence delivered, some of the performances did as well, and there were certainly some stand out scenes, but nothing was going to save this mess from the poor writing. Without going into spoilers, the Groucho/Elvis scene was SO BAD that I cringed and wondered to myself how someone was capable of not only writing such crap but then seeing it through filming and final edit and still not having the sense to cut it. We got you Rob, you did your homework on the Marx Brothers, and I get you were probably mad that some didn't catch your homage in the first film, but there is no excuse to add a scene like the one you just did. A. It made no sense and B. It did nothing for the story. That's not the only scene like that in the film either. The chicken scene, the ice cream scene, I could go on. It seems to me Rob really respects Tarantino, and who doesn't? But, he's not even close to being on level with him, so the previously mentioned scenes come off instead sounding as a poor imitator trying to write dialog that he believes will be memorable and good enough to carry a scene without moving the story along, i.e. Royale with cheese.I could keep going but I will cut it short. Bottom line, this was film school on a big budget and I mean this as no insult on the part of TALENTED filmmakers in film school. Rob you should stick to directing short subject music videos. You have style no doubt, but leave the writing to the people that can do it well. There are plenty of talented indie directors that deserve the budget and crew you work with and it's a shame. I hate being this harsh because I really give Rob credit for beating the odds and getting these films made, and anyone who is trying to help push the horror genre along is worth a look in my book, but this film in my opinion deserves every negative word it gets.One last word on the cast. Bill Moseley was fantastic, even given some of the unlikely dialog for his character(Mark Twain s***?). Leslie Easterbrook was the best of the crop(Karen who?). And William Forsythe was as good as expected. As for Sheri Moon Zombie, I'm glad Rob is proud of his wife's ass, but it seems to be becoming a plot point. Sheri you look great, which might be good enough to get you on an album cover, but please take a few acting lessons before trying the big screen again. And finally Sid was great, but much better in the first one.4 out of 10 stars. Wait for the rental.","rw1134601","I wanted to like it Rob...

Why bother remaking something that has an audience that loves the original in the first place is the $64,000 question most average filmgoers would be saying aloud and I'm hard-pressed to disagree?

But if you are going to do it, perhaps you should I dunno make it better?In the latest Hollywood misgivings about damn-to-hell-what-the-audience-wants-let's simply-recycle-a-hit-from-the-past-and-worry-about-the-conseque nces-later offering the result is a practically serviceable yet play-by-play 'safe' remaking of the comedy classic that starred the lovably gruff, messed-bed persona of the beleaguered Walter Matthau in all his schlumpy glory as the grizzled, beer-drinking never-was of a big-league ballplayer reduced to cleaning swimming pools in sunny Southern California musing about his one time only appearance in the majors while managing a ragtag little league ball team of misfits, losers and foul-language spewing tykes which unearthed a new sports themed subgenre: the pathetic team of misfits, losers and foul-language spewing tykes which have been seen in everything from THE MIGHTY DUCKS to the recent REBOUND with its pedestrian scripts and bathroom humor that has run stale since the original BEARS' first unworthy sequel!Well now indie cum Hollywood darling Richard Linklater (SCHOOL OF ROCK, DAZED AND CONFUSED) comes equipped with a faithful yet raunchy enough screenplay by BAD SANTA scribes Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who manage to update the Bill Lancaster script and Michael Ritchie's direction with enough pallid political incorrectness (except for one glaring omission in one of the lines spoken by the most foul player, Tanner Boyle (which I'm going to do likewise in fear of rebuttal; yeah, that's the times we live in folks, but dammit the line is funny and it's a JOKE!) and sexual humor to make the most hardened go-figure curmudgeon chuckle.Thornton fills Matthau's shoes as Morris Buttermaker, a drunken ex-ball player who is now an exterminator here but still a souse with a lousy demeanor, who is coerced by an attorney child-rights activist named Liz Whitehood (the sexy Harden) and an undisclosed check to coach the Bears, the worst team ever assembled (thanks to the political correctness we know have an Indian nerd and a chubby kid in a wheelchair rounding out the token black kid, two Mexican brothers and the fat kid whose on Atkins and not a junk food junkie).Buttermaker enlists the aid of Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kraft), a tweener pitching sensation he knew from his ill-fated relationship with her mom, when he realizes the kids really deserve more than the shellacking they received in their debut to the much-hated rivals, the Yankees led by Roy Bullock (Kinnear substituting yuppie weaseldom from Vic Morrow's gruff general bullying) who wants Buttermaker to take a hike.Also tacked on is grungy trouble making Kelly Leak (Jeff Davies) who Bullock can't stomach but proves to be a true athlete in power-hitting and displaying a keen touch for the outfield to boot as Buttermaker suddenly realizes the Bears may actually have a shot at the championship title.The film pretty much stays fast and loose but connect-the-dots similar to its original (even in an uncanny shot-by-shot of Leak's batting practice homer gliding into an actual game!) Not necessarily a bad thing but even though the screenwriters give Buttermaker a more active sexual life (sporting a bodacious babe here and there and even taking the kids to Hooters for a post-game celebration is inspired) it makes one wonder where it could've gone had they gone the R-rated route (which frankly the original came close to skirting as well). Thornton's sardonic Southern fried delivery is priceless  he's more chicken-fried steak than Matthau's salisbury and elicits enough contempt to distill the easily found treacle bubbling below (making the kids into winners) and Linklater, a personal fave of mine, seems to have found a unique niche: making kid films adult friendly.While it isn't an instant classic like the first flick  I blame that for the frankly carbon copies of the kids shown here  to wit, Tatum O'Neal actually emoted as Amanda in the '76 version! - (hell the Tanner kid looks and sounds just like the first one's! it's scary!) but they seem to be having a ball.

Sometimes to add something to the developing story, sometimes to create ambiguity about it. A storyline is revealed, just to be put in question in the next scene. The question can be posed if what we actually see (including the after-stories) in the end are the real stories, or are they also twisted like so many others. Is what we see the truth, or only a version of it? A person pretends to be another one (his brother), acting in a movie as an interpretation of him. A priest becomes a publisher's house agent once his life story is made to a script. A script is written and rewritten several times. The script is in contrast with other events going on.Pedro Almodóvar throws in some mild criticism of movies that try to sensationalize things in a cheap way.

It's stupid, amateurishly made, and mediocrely scripted. The little love story element makes no sense, isn't really built up to, yet that is one of the MINOR matters of this film. It must have been very low budget, too. They don't even bother to show a plane crash, instead simply showing it angled downward (by tilting the camera in a close-up) and then having it referred to afterwards as having crashed.Films compress time; I get that. But the lead actor repeatedly picking up the rocket-propelled-grenade launcher, which he had stolen from a bad-guy but without grabbing any accompanying supplies, without reloading it but magically new rockets kept appearing for him to shoot, one-at-a-time, until the last time he picks it up, it that time has not been reloaded, so he then says something like, \"Darn, out of ammo,\" is jarring. He pushes a jeep over a cliff with his truck but the bad guys don't bother to shoot at him until he's down the road, out of range.This resembles an elementary school play, written by kids themselves, with no goal other than to just get through it, not worrying about logic or entertainment along the way. A typical prairie fire has as much action as this flick, and watching the park service burn one off would be as entertaining as sitting through this, as at least then you know there's a future pay-off. The above no doubt sound like gags but I'm afraid they're true. Why do people who have so little film-making talent and so little interest in making something good go into this business? I agree exactly with the other comment about Haing Ngor but then say that we viewers should not consider stuff like this even simply acceptable time-killing material. This just plain stinks. The one thing I will say for the flick is that part of the ending was OK but those few seconds sure didn't make the rest of the viewing experience worthwhile. For that matter, another part of the ending was meant to be clever but it's something I'd seen and read as the \"twist\" in a bunch of other gold stories so had even predicted it.What's more, UPN repeatedly promoted this as \"starring Martin Sheen,\" only ever mentioning him at all, yet he's only in one per cent of it.

These were Stan Lee's original superheroes with \"feet of clay\" (even before Spider-man). But the real heart of the comic was the Thing (Ben Grimm)--the big, tough wise guy with the big broken heart. And he is the one thing the movie got right--Michael Chiklis (and the impressive make up) capture the Thing perfectly.Unfortunately there are three other team members, who need to be \"developed\": Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), Sue Storm (the Invisible Girl, er, Woman), and Johnny Storm (the Human Torch). Ah, for the old comic-book origin story, where the four are shot up into space, are exposed to \"cosmic rays,\" crash back to earth, and immediately start manifesting their super powers. Before you know it, they're fighting the Mole Man (and sometimes each other).If only the movie had used such shorthand. Instead, well over half the flick is \"family\" bickering as the Four discover their abilities--and the origin of Dr. Doom (their greatest enemy) is outlined.Doom is the movie's most serious misstep. In the comic books, Doom was a scientist who falls from the \"pure faith\" (yes, \"he tampered in God's domain,\" to lift a bit from Ed Wood's \"Bride of the Monster\"). He had a regalness and grandeur about him, even as he tried to destroy the FF and take over the world (the perfect opposite of Reed). In the movie, Doom is another tiresome industrialist who (ala Norman \"Green Goblin\" Osborn) obtains super powers. His showdown with the FF at the end is somewhat less than epic (and the climax rips off a bit of \"Terminator 2\").The whole movie feels as though they shot a first-draft script (characters fairly trip over the loose ends, and Reed is about as much of a super genius as Wile E.

It has none of the flash nor special effects of today's summer blockbusters that are churned out by Hollywood's factories (such as the silly Will Smith \"Bad Boys\" flicks). No slow motion shots of the hero calmly walking towards the camera while stuff explodes real good behind him. What \"Cent jours a Palerme\" (French title) has is heart - a gritty, almost documentary feel that makes the violence in the film seem more \"real\" in a way than anything we've seen in the past several years.It also features Lino Ventura, one of the greatest actors from the 70's and 80's. Ventura was known for the hardboiled characters he used to play - usually police detectives. (He was a real life tough guy - started out as a wrestler.) The man always has a hard cold look in his eyes that hints at times of a fury hidden within; and other times great sadness. (\"Garde a vue\" is certainly one of his masterpieces.) In 100 Days in Palermo he plays a retired head of the Italian Federal Police who is sent to Sicily as a Prefect (a political appointed job with power to direct police investigations), for the purpose of taking on the Mafia - following a series of assassinations of judges and prosecutors. He's a man of great integrity and drive, which makes him likable. But he also suffers from some serious flaws, some of which I found maddening. But that also makes him a real person, which added to my appreciation of the character.Finally, this is one of the last great \"anti-Hollywood\" flicks with a \"realistic\" ending. No idiotic happy completion where the good guys win and the bad guys are blown away. In this sense, the film is very much a work from the 70's (even though it was made in the early 80's). Can you imagine a big studio production made nowadays with an ending like the ones in \"The Deer Hunter\" or \"Apocalypse Now\"? Not a chance. And this is not to say that this film in any way reaches the heights of the two aforementioned masterpieces - it certainly does not - but I'm simply making a point.It's not the absolute best of its genre, but nevertheless is well worth viewing, especially if you enjoy the European style political paranoia and pessimism of the 70's.","rw1134617","Anti-Hollywood thriller","Billygoat",0],[["6","15"],"3-Iron (2004)","5","24 July 2005","I just got back from seeing 3-Iron.

To the extent there is a story, it's largely a didactic one of juxtaposition between two men -- one compassionate and flawed, one evil, to the point of straw-man bad guy.

I'm a fan of art cinema, and I generally eschew the dogma that cinema necessarily requires dramatic conflict. So, in the hands of the right director, film as conceptual art works for me.

Some people have been giving this film a pass, saying \"not bad for a firt effort,\" or even claiming \"Braff really knows what he's doing behind the camera.\" Well, as someone who's gone through a graduate film program, I can tell you, this IS bad for a first-time effort; Braff does not seem to know much about what he's doing behind the camera; and many of the blunders in this film would not be acceptable in a student film, much less a feature. 2 things really bugged me. One, how the hell did he get Ian Holm to show up? Does he have pictures of him naked with a sheep or something? Two, and this is them kind of precious garbage that enrages me in films like this, good thing there's a vintage WWII era motorcycle lying around in the garage, complete with sidecar, because, y'know, it looks really neato. While saying nothing at all about character or story.I don't know Mr. Braff, but he seems to havepoured rather too much of himself into this flick, and convinced himself that virtually every cliché of 20-something ennui constitutes blinding, revelatory insight. I am at an utter loss to explain this film's 8 out of 10 IMDb rating, except to posit that those raving over how deep this film is are the same sort of self-involved, self-pitying spoiled rich white kids from Jersey, or similar environs, who seem to share Mr. Braff's conceit that their commonplace and often trivial hardships constitute the stuff of tragic melodrama.

A group of teenagers who are running late hitch a ride on fishing boat and they arrived to find the scene completely deserted. Though, something isn't quite right as they find an abandon house where they discover some party-goers who claimed that they were attacked by some sort of zombies. Now it's up to this group of people to figure a way to get off the island or they shall meet an unpleasant demise from hordes of zombies.So, this is \"House of the dead\" and I just got to say it was just woefully incompetent schlock. I guess my curiosity just got the better of me when I saw it was playing on TV. While watching it, I thought it was on the music channel at times, as it mainly felt like an over-extended music clip. Director Uwe Boll's film is nothing but pretentious garbage and an incredibly lousy effort. It really has nothing going for it well, it did have nice island scenery and fair makeup effects and a good amount of blood and gore. But these things couldn't carry this plain dreadful film. On show are paper-thin material and unlikeable characters. The actual lacklustre plot fails logic, it's filled with yawn inducing clichés, even the back-story of these zombies is poorly setup and it ends with a diabolical finale. Though, what it sorely missed was humour! But then again it probably thought it was funny, but I just didn't see it. It felt like the film was actually taking itself rather serious and if so, well there you go. The performances are either wooden or atrocious and the characters are mundane and annoying. You just don't care for these hoons. There's even a young Bruce Campbell look alike, but he doesn't have the charisma or talent of that great actor. The dialogue is rather mindless drivel, which is filled with bad puns and mind numbing lines. It's nothing but tripe and stereotypical circumstances.The direction is just a muddle. Boll was trying too hard to make his film super coooool. Instead he lacked imagination in his execution, therefore making it super dull and uneventful. What else didn't help was the dumb editing of sequences of the actual video game to cut to new scenes. The score was mostly nonexistent, but not the damn techno soundtrack that pop up during the action scenes my ears!!! It was just too much. When the techno music kicked in, so did the flashy camera-work that also got on my nerves. With its 360 degrees camera shots and shaky panning. Though, it was the slow-mows, which Boll centred on and really, it was not needed. It was just too distracting and rather lame. These action set pieces went on for far too long, which made it feel like everything was in slow-mow. What didn't help these moments was that no tension was generated and the action was mainly unexciting and pedestrian. No scares or thrills are evident. The romance sequences were just odd and rather laughable, with some characters finding love while battling zombies. A lot moments became a real drag because they dwelled on nothingness and too many sequences became really repetitive e.g. too many save yourself scenarios and a lot chasing about I mean a lot! Some shots were actually used over and over again. Yes, this is a pointless and unsatisfying mess of a production. After seeing this film you'll be thinking what the hell was that?

It was two years in the making for director Juraj Jakubisko. The story is based on the prophesies of Nostradomus, that's why it takes place in a non existent time. At first I though I was watching a time piece film, but later you see a motorcycle, helicopters and men in contamination suits. Some of the costumes of the film are strange looking, especially if your not familiar with European culture. There is Czech folk outfits, men with feather hats and other strange gypsy like clothes. Don't let the outfits distract you, because the film is simply amazing. The beginning is disturbing as the village is massacred by wolves after a wedding. Even a baby and children fall victim. The musical score was so powerful, that this scene haunted me long after it was over.In the attack, a man named Goran saves a baby, Verona the mother promises him the daughters hand in marriage when she gets older. Then the movie goes ten years into the future. A circus comes to town and becomes a slight disruption for the village. There's a crazy cast of Felliniesque circus freaks. There's an 8 foot tall lady, a midget and even a monkey. The film even includes a kiss between the the midget and monkey. Weird huh? Finally the film goes further in the future by ten years, but the environment looks the same. Goran finally marries the girl, because she is now twenty. But Goran still has feelings for the girls mother. So the situation turns into a folk gypsy Jerry Springer style drama, except without the trailer court. An Ambiguous Report.... is original and unlike anything you have ever seen. Gorgeous cinematography, heartfelt performances, haunting images and an amazing musical score by Jan Jirasek. Director Juraj Jakubisko won many well deserved awards, including 4 Czech Lions. I enjoy eastern European directors because they put there heart and soul into all their work.

She doesn't lose it with decorous resignation, as she did in familiar masterpieces by Wong Kar-Wai and Stanley Kwan. Instead, she insults and jostles her way to the bottom, ditching the reticence that constrained her in nearly every other film she's made.Seldom heard until now, her clipped British English is underscored at first by breakneck speech-rhythms, cadences en route to a crackup: these telegraph the destructive impatience of her character. A procession of gas stations, wheezing old cars and stained Formica desks follows, terminating in contracts signed with descending water-spray scribbles. The Eno-dependent score draws on _Another Green World_, the visuals, _Paris, Texas_. Her heroin/death crash gives way to temporary calm, which is jostled into verbal violence again after her character moves to Paris. That setting is where her character seems most natural and believable: berating and brushing away friends in a culture peculiarly disposed to viewing argumentativeness as courage and social dysfunction as passion.Chung's addict isn't always N.A.-accurate, but her delineation of the role she was asked to play borders on virtuosic. Much as one loves seeing Chung embody the perfect suffering torch-song icon in films like Center Stage and In the Mood for Love, it is thrilling to hear her claim other languages, styles and emotional idioms as her own. Even her singing is antithetical to the voice of her earlier characters. And it isn't an accident that she is cast against a restrained Nick Nolte, who portrayed a raging drunk so affectingly in _Affliction_, and a complacent bohemian Béatrice Dalle, whose superficially flawed gap-toothed beauty and eccentric portrayals have provided temporary pleasure in so many dystopian films.Despite Clean's hoary conceit -- heroin weaning as spiritual redemption -- the cinematography is beautiful and evocative, particularly the landscape pans. As in Drugstore Cowboy, one feels the drugs and the music to be an arbitrary pretext for a film that is actually about something else.The music references are embarrassing. Particularly wince-making are repeated references to Mazzy Star, since that's who Chung's character is intended to resemble (could the director have been more obvious?). The model isn't surprising, given Chung's orientation: One way to get a convincing performance out of a non-singer is to develop a character voice -- in this case, something deadpan and breathy, with almost no vibrato. Even so, the director's lack of finesse is revealed insofar as Mazzy Star's name is mentioned at all -- let alone repeated and underlined by two different characters.Chung plays a vintage failed rock singer well in the San Francisco studio, with her careless beaten unbranded leather, AKG K-240 headphones, Neumann TLM-103 caged mike, pop filter (though she doesn't need one) and groggy swaying motion. Even so, it's Chung's mastery of her character's pacing that seems most musical, not the voice she musters or the blues dirge she happens to sing. One wonders what Nicholas Roeg would have to say about her, um, performance.As always with Chung, the emotional repression of the character is what makes her breakdown so affecting. In work that is elegiac, one always wants the tears to come slowly: talking oneself out of them, bracing oneself, is what forces emotion to surface in the end.","rw1134623","In the Mood for a Virtuosic Performance","scrypt@rcn.com",0],[["3","5"],"Der Philosoph (1989)","8","25 July 2005","Hardly an erotic film, but then real sex is often something different from 'sexy' (and rather better).The plot is that an academic and socially inept philosophy student who is working on his thesis meets an attractive woman who may or may not be imaginary.The woman is not only attractive, she has a personality. (How often do you see that in a film like this?). The philosopher and the woman become friends and then begin to have sex. (Not the way round things happen in most erotic films). He then meets her two friends who share her apartment, and when he has grown close to them, has sex with each of them in turn (and various other permutations).The film shows a fair amount of flesh, but it has the undriven and exploratory quality of narrative of a real drama. One would need to be extremely blunt to manage to get through any sequence of this film without thinking about what is happening on-screen.As with very few films (and hardly any English-language ones) this is a film about sex without being in any expected sense an erotic film.I enjoy it more every time I watch it.

They both hurt like crazy, it's just that one probably isn't as painful as the other. DON'T GO IN THE WOODS appears to be the retarded, illegitimate offspring of James C.Wasson's quietly unsettling NIGHT OF THE DEMON and the underrated JUST BEFORE DAWN. It's the simple story of a group of happy campers (including a bunch of whiny teens, a birdwatcher who looks like an old silent movie actor, a cripple who looks like Franklin from THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, a female artist and her baby daughter, two bone-chillingly unattractive newlyweds and...you get the idea) whose weekend in the Utah wilderness is rudely interrupted by a bloodthirsty maniac who looks and sounds like Long John Silver gone native and kills people for kicks. And that's it. There's no real plot, not a scrap of characterization, no structure, no dynamic, in fact nothing to compel or even mildly interest the viewer, just endless scenes of these hapless non-actors wandering through the forest and getting killed in various unlikely ways, with blood-drenched murder scenes that resemble Monty Python's memorable spoof of Sam Peckinpah, only done on a smaller budget. As a substitute for any on-screen suspense or drama, the belching, clanking, burbling synthesizer score by H.Kingsley Thurber (love that name!) plays throughout the entire film with no let-up. I'm not joking, it doesn't stop until the end credits when we get to hear him sing an inane ditty about the murderer to the tune of 'The Teddy Bear's Picnic'! Most of the dialogue seems to have been endlessly redubbed and rearranged, which gives the proceedings a surreal, ethereal feel, and the direction and editing are not so much undisciplined as wilfully perverse - it's as if Bryan tore up the entry-level director's handbook on day one, set out to break all the rules and succeeded unequivocally. It would be churlish to point out that the budget was obviously miniscule, since wonders can be worked for a handful of change - see LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, for example - but the budget for this Z-grade splatterfest would appear to have come from the pockets of sleeping gutterbums. As a further point of interest, this film remains banned in the UK, though I can't imagine any sensible distributor paying the censors to watch this nonsense in order to receive an 18 certificate.

It is 1913 and the Danes smell war in the air - though they are uncertain whether it will involve them or not.The film falls very oddly between being a not-very-interesting sex-comedy (all the women seem anxious to get laid, but we see very little except copious lingerie from any of them) and a much more intriguing montage of village life reacting to imminent war with a mixture of confusion and indifference.One could certainly watch the film without any attention to the erotic element. Sytten contains one of the few accurate loss-of-virginity scenes before Catherine Breillat, but all the rest of the porn is so anodyne as to be tedious. The photography of Nybro is lovingly attentive to detail though, and the attempt to capture belle epoque class certainty and political confusion if genuinely thought provoking.I thought this was a very good film, though I can see why it will disappoint almost everyone who watches it. The erotic content is either silly or annoyingly accurate (the people who watch erotic films seldom have any interest in real sex) but it certainly gets in the way of the rather unusual gentle nostalgia which should have been the film's forte.The other films I've seen from Anneliese Meineche were all just as confused.","rw1134626","Eh?","garwy",0],[["1","4"],"War of the Worlds (2005)","10","25 July 2005","War of the worlds is one of my favorite movie.

The movie might have been funny if the acting wasn't so good, and his dark descent into madness wasn't so believable. But the performance and the writing and direction lift this work out of 'the theater of the absurd' where I might have been able to laugh at it, into a 'realism' that transformed even the generous helpings of comedic irony into a growing pile of acute and sorrowful evidences of just how pathetic the main character had become.If you enjoy very dark humor, good acting for acting's own sake, or have a fascination with insanity, you might enjoy this film.This film might be valuable for discussing insanity, the depravity/corruptibility of man, or the fragility of the human psyche.","rw1134630","Not an enjoyable film","ollwen",0],[["4","7"],"I girasoli (1970)",null,"25 July 2005","So many reviews talk of the beauty of this film, but you can't see it on the horribly transferred DVD I saw from Netflix last weekend. So much of the color has been drained from the source, and you'd thought the movie was shot in experimental color in 1939 instead of 1970. Shame on the quick-buck types who have violated De Sica's original film. It's simply awful to watch. I had never seen this emotional film about an Italian couple who marry on the eve of his being sent to the Russian front. He never returns, and she never gives up hope of his return. The Loren/Mastroianni pairing has always been potent on the screen. And it is so here with Loren utterly magnificent as the loving wife and the grief-struck and abandoned woman later on. When the wife travels to Russia to find him years after the war, she's much older, and her life has been ruined. So the scene where she finally is connected to him through his Russian wife, and then sees him arriving at the local train station, is truly heartbreaking. While he has committed himself to his new life in Russia, marrying another woman and father two children, Loren's face shows her disappointment and overwhelming sense of sadness as she finally see that all that this woman has is now denied to her. Mastroianni has a bothersome role here. It is Loren who initially proposes they marry at the beginning of the film. He's just another callow fellow having a fling before he goes off to war. Later when he's nearly dead from walking through the frozen Russian winter, in retreat and trying to get back to Italy, his character finally gives up and falls down in the snow to die. He is saved by a beautiful Russian girl who drags him back to civilization. I guess, grateful for her ministrations, he eventually marries her and settles into a new life in Russia. So the character is rather passive to begin with, robbing Mastroianni of his usual comic bombast. In the end, you wonder why waste these two screen giants on this weeper of a movie. I have always adored Loren. Besides her jaw-dropping beauty, she always projected such warmth, generosity of spirit, a sense of fun, and when called for, she could be as great playing tragedy as any screen actress of any generation. TWO WOMEN proved that, and films such as A SPECIAL DAY and Marriage Italian STYLE only underlined the marvelous acting skills she possessed. So it's disappointing to see her giving her usual great self to a property that isn't quite worthy of her.

In this absorbing drama, which is only one book of a monumental Catholic work by Marcia Davenport, Greer Garson plays a pretty and bright young woman who takes a job in the lavish home of a Pittsburgh steel magnate, played honestly and strongly veteran actor Donald Crisp. Gregory Peck plays one of his sons, the serious one, who is devoted to his father's mill and who works alongside some of the mill workers, including his friend Preston Foster. The father has two other sons--Dan Duryea, who is more desirous of having money rather than of working; and Marshall Thompson, who has turned to alcohol in his unhappiness...There is also a daughter played by the fine actress Marsha Hunt, perhaps one of her best performances. Gladys Cooper plays the matriarch of the family, who befriends Garson, and leaves her her shares in the mill. Garson's father, played with skill by Lionel Barrymore, is an embittered man, who lost the use of his legs in an accident in the mill, and did not want his daughter working for the owners. It is he who begets violence that has tragic consequences. Jessica Tandy plays Peck's wife, a bitter woman; Peck should have married Garsop all along, of course; but the climax of the film is the troubles at the steel mill that are started by the angry workers and the consequences on all concerned of this violent crisis action. There are many finely-developed characters in this long film, but I sense also a fair sense of fatality about the events, intended by the author, against which the attraction of persons, characters and dispositions of Peck and Garson are played, like two rays of sunlight illuminating a dark jungle's zone. Thiis attractive B/W production was directed by Tay Garnett. Marcia Davenport long novel was adapted to the screen by fine scenarist Sonya Levien and John Meehan. The cinematography for the film was the work of Joseph Ruttenberg and Herbert Stothart composed the dramatic score. When I say that the art direction was done by Cedric Gibbons with Paul Groesse, the set decorations by Edwin B. Willis and the costume designs by Irene, I have accounted for the film's very-opulent and vivid production values. In the cast apart from the principals already mentioned, one can see Barbara Everest, Geraldine Wall, Eveline Dockson, John Warburton, Rusell Hicks, Mary Lord, Arthur Shields, young Dean Stockwell, Maru Courier, Lumsden Hare, Connie Golchrist and Anna Q. Nilsson. This is always an attractive and a carefully-considered production, which occasionally seems to me to lack warmth; with a great script, everyone concerned could perhaps have produced a masterpiece. With the one they had, the talents involved produced a memorable adventure that rises on occasion to first-rate dramatic heights. Not to be missed, perhaps.

If you open your eyes (and your heart) wide enough to allow yourself to become invested in these characters and their myriad of authentic, human flaws, you will be justly rewarded.Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) is severely depressed. She's a recovering alcoholic who's trying to get over the loss of her husband. In her lethargy she fails to get a bogus tax charge cleared from her record, and her house is seized and sold in whirlwind fashion. Lester, the deputy sheriff (Ron Eldard) in charge of evicting Kathy, feels for her plight and soon falls in love with her. Massoud Amir Behrani (Kingsley) is an ex-Iranian Air Force colonel who is practically working himself to death trying to provide for his family. He sees the house as an opportunity that he  and his family  desperately needs. Kathy wants her house back, but Behrani has done nothing wrong and refuses to sell it. The house is of vital importance to multiple parties, and none of them are willing to yield.\"The House of Sand and Fog\" is an utter masterpiece and a great tragedy. It doesn't take long to figure that out: only a little ways into the film you'll think to yourself, \"Oh, this can't end well.\" And it does not. Along the way, you'll witness very real people making very human mistakes: bad decisions that push the conflict to the point where lives are permanently shattered. The acting is simply flawless, and I think Ben Kingsley might very well be the greatest actor alive.One of the movie's greatest strengths is its sympathetic portrayal of BOTH sides. The movie is fair to both Kathy and Behrani, although initially I was not. While watching the movie, I was completely unsympathetic towards Kathy. She was irresponsible, illogical, and petulant. My opinion of her didn't start to soften until she hits rock bottom near the end of the film. Was my opinion of her started to change, I saw another point of the film: this entire situation could have been averted if either side took the time to consider the others' point of view.Yes, Kathy was irresponsible, but the root source of her problem was a government screw-up: something that wasn't her fault and never should have come about in the first place. Her lethargy and failure to get the problem resolved exacerbated the situation, unquestionably, but it wasn't the cause of the situation. It's certainly very easy to sit in your recliner and condemn her actions. But the tough route is to accept her as a flawed human being and feel sympathy for her poor decisions. The way this character acts is NOT unreasonable if you account for human emotion; having \"characters with flaws\" is not the same as having \"flawed characters.\"Kathy's problem also brings to light an interesting aspect in our civil governments: in America you are supposed to be innocent until proved guilty, but often life imitates the art in the movie, where the county pushes ahead like a steamroller, completely ruining Kathy before they even took a moment to stop and realize they had made a mistake (those who view this as a \"contrived\" plot hook have obviously never had extensive dealings with any form of government).One of the themes of the film is that it presents a battle between emotion and logic. Each side is equally valid, and sometime a balance is difficult to reach between the two. Kathy is emotion. Her emotional attachment to her family's house leads her to bad decision after bad decision. And really, how much more human can you get? Hasn't every single one of us, at some (several) point(s) in our life, allowed emotion to overrule our common sense? Haven't we all made decisions based almost solely on emotion that have ended up only making things worse?Behrani, on the other hand, is logic. He's ex-military. He's very rigid, very right-and-wrong, very black-and-white, very unyielding. He's not completely soulless  his family is obviously more important to him than anything in the world  but he's also not easily swayed by emotional entreaties. However, I still felt that Behrani and his family were the most sympathetic characters in the film, mainly because they weren't the ones making all the bad decisions that kept making things worse. They truly get swept up in a situation beyond their control.If there is a \"bad guy\" in the film, it's the sheriff, Lester. He's Emotion, part two, and again, he's not a terrible person, just someone who lets his emotions get the better of him and makes a series of poor decisions. He's a cop who's unhappy in his marriage and just looking for an excuse out of it. When he meets and falls in love with Kathy, not only does he see an easy way out of his marriage, but he takes it upon himself to be the knight in shining armor, the protector for her.The tension escalates until the situation comes to a head, naturally, and it is a stroke of the darkest irony that begins the denouement of the film: when Kathy reaches rock bottom it is the Behranis who save her, and it is this unexpected act of kindness that gets misunderstood and leads to the tragic conclusion. The end of the film has a one-two finishing punch that's as heartbreaking as just about any movie you're apt to see.But don't let that dissuade you: the ending is actually one of the movie's greatest strengths. \"The House of Sand and Fog\" doesn't try to insult the audience with a contrived, upbeat finish. The characters are real, flawed people making real, human decisions which lead to a unfortunate conclusion. Which leaves the movie with perhaps its final, harshest message: some of life's lessons are learned at a tremendous cost.","rw1134651","Masterpiece","Phantom Phan",0],[["9","10"],"Amon Saga (1986)","6","25 July 2005","AMON SAGA (1986) is a sword-and-sorcery anime tale that runs 75 minutes. Amon, the hero of the piece, is reminiscent of Conan the Barbarian but has the long light hair and pretty features of a \"bishonen\" character. It's not clear where or when this is set although it has all the trappings of standard sword-and-sorcerymonsters, evil lord, castles, princess-in-distress, musclebound sidekick, crafty spy, wizened sorcerers, etc. An original touch here is the giant turtle on which the evil Lord Valhiss's kingdom and castle are situated. The turtle tromps slowly through the countryside, stopping to pick up mercenary warriors along the way, including our hero Amon who soon makes it his business to rescue Lichia, a princess from another kingdom held hostage so that Lord Valhiss can get a map showing the way to the Valley of Gold, where all the competing parties will eventually converge for the climactic confrontation.The storyline isn't terribly compelling since we don't really know what's at stake for the protagonists or what kind of world they're occupying. The best sword-and-sorcery anime, like the 1997 TV series \"Berserk,\" makes sure to ground the viewers in the geopolitical specifics of the setting. Sure, Amon and Lichia are sweet and endearing, but the only reason we'd like to see them get together is the fact that they're the only good-looking people in the entire piece. Amon is quite handsome and Lichia quite beautiful, with her long blue-green hair and slender, pale, delicate body, but it's not unreasonable to ask for more reason to root for them than that.The main reason to watch AMON SAGA is the artwork, including participation in the character design by renowned pop artist Yoshitaka Amano, who's designed video games and anime and done artwork for fantasy and graphic novels. Much of the artwork in AMON indeed resembles some of the best fantasy fiction illustration. We see many breathtaking landscapes and occasional multicolored magical effects. The character design is marked by that great 1980s anime look of bold lines, straightforward detail and bright colors. It's always eminently watchable, but one wishes the story was a little more interesting and the action a little rougher.","rw1134652","Beautiful design and artwork elevate routine anime adventure","BrianDanaCamp",0],[["5","8"],"Jaws: The Revenge (1987)","5","25 July 2005","Of course, it's not exactly \"Top 250\"-material either. But this movie isn't as bad as some people say. Regardless of that, I personally think that most people agree with me when I say that it's better than it's predecessor, \"Jaws 3\". There are several reasons to this. First, the action scenes are better in this one. I liked the surroundings better too. The Caribbean was a really great place to shoot a Jaws-movie. The story isn't very good, but I think it's nearly impossible to make a good story this late in the series. On the interesting side, Michael Caine is in this movie. Is there any movie at all that this man refuses to take part in? It doesn't look like it.","rw1134654","The \"Bottom 100\" at IMDb is not the right place for this movie","sveknu",0],[["1","2"],"Swordfish (2001)","3","25 July 2005","I didn't catch this one when it was out in the cinema but had seen the trailers for it back in the day and had heard good things about it so I checked it out on DVD the other day, but wasn't at all impressed with what I got for my buck.The basic premise for the plot is quite interesting: A very shady guy (played by Travolta) needs the services of a super hacker (Hugh Jackman) in order to gain access to and snatch a whopping amount of Dollars from highly suspect government accounts. It also has a fine cast  John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Vinnie Jones and Don Cheadle, and apparently a sizeable budget to throw at some furious action as well. All the ingredients are here for a fine flick, even a great one, if all the basic ingredients were tied together with a good and well-told story  but this is where it all goes down the drain for me.The basic premise is good, but way it is realised is very disappointing. The characters are all superficial beyond belief. Travolta's character is by far the best  a psycho who is nigh on impossible to get a read on. He is obviously nuts and does a great deal of bad things, but he appears to believe that he is working for the greater good  in his book, two wrongs seem very able to make a right. He has some fun lines and some of the dialogue is even mildly thought provoking. If every aspect of this movie were up to the standards of Travolta's acting and the realisation of the character he is playing this would indeed be an interesting flick, but this is where the fun stops.Hugh Jackman's character, for example, is almost as bad as Travolta's is good. Jackman's acting isn't to blame, but the way we get to view this character, his motivation and personality never really catches on with the viewer. I think we are supposed to root for him and his getting to be with his daughter, but because he is so superficially portrayed, we never really get to feel for him or his relationship with his daughter, and if things are put bluntly, this could just as well have been cut from the story altogether. The movie would have worked just as well, if not better, had Jackman been in it for the money alone and not for his daughter.The additional characters in the story are even more superficially portrayed. We never really get to look inside the head of any of the cop(s) who seem to be our basic good guys or the government suits who seem to be our basic bad guys. Why Cheadle's character or the bad senator even have names must be down to simple convenience of reference, rather than any desire to bring the viewer closer to them as characters. They could just as well remain nameless as they are totally generic and without any depth of character beyond a face and a name. The motivation and behaviour of all the side characters in this movie are pretty much nonexistent.And what if you aren't into characterisation and stuff like that? Is the action alone enough to get a slight kick out of the movie? Personally I don't think so. There really isn't a lot of it, and again, the execution of it isn't above par.To surmise, I was rather disappointed with the movie. If you look for a story-driven plot, you could well be frustrated by the lack of character depth and the way the story is put together and presented, and you are likely to be disappointed by the lack of plausibility that comes in the wake of the misgivings presented above. You will wonder, \"why did that guy do that\", \"why didn't he do that instead\" and \"why didn't we get to see what happened there\" far more often than you will enjoy an occasional fun comment, a good bit of action, or Halle Berry's fine bod.This could easily have been a worthwhile movie, if only the story was better put together and executed. But as it is, the most positive way I can describe it is as a below average action movie with a plot and characters that are totally neglected.3/10","rw1134655","Travolta and Halle Berry's fine bod fight a losing battle to make this a worthwhile flick.","DragonRyder",0],[["5","20"],"Hustle & Flow (2005)","1","25 July 2005","I saw the movie this week and thought it was absolutely AWFUL !!!

These people need to lighten up - its a comedy and a straight man being hit on by a creepy gay guy while being tied to the bed is funny particularly when that straight guy is Vince Vaughn.

The task of picking a movie was assigned to me. But seeing that I haven't been catching up with movies listing for nearly 6 weeks, I found it a tough job. Summer really was deprived of attention-grabbing movie titles. My Chinese friends were turned off by the title of this flick itself, The Island. I mean, seriously, who would want to watch a movie called 'The Island', especially when they have no idea what is it all about in the first place? If it wasn't for the brief printed summary at the counter, I would not have given this movie a second glance. Like War of The Worlds, its poster was not self-explanatory. Plus, I did not watch the trailer prior to my trip to the cinema.BUT, unlike War of The Worlds (or any other movies before this), for once I did not question the logic of the flow of the storyline. The storyline was good enough for me to not stop focusing and start being a cynic. At the very least, questions that the average viewer might ask about the plot are answered. It was 100% NOT boring and the plot holes in this movie was subtle because of the relatively fast pace of the story growth. In fact, though I had only watched it once, I don't remember any noticeable loop holes in the storyline. Or questionable action scenes for that matter. I didn't cared if there were futuristic technologies in the movie. After all, the whole thing took place in the future. It was nice that it blended in with the contemporary definitions of the current world, all so that everything seemed viably realistic.Now, there is humor here and there, blended in nicely with action and drama. Noticeable humor genres are satire, sarcasm and banter. The director, Micheal Bay, cleverly played with \"human\" innocence in the movie. The whole innocence thing somehow reminded me of how complex our minds have made today to be. How open the minds of those \"humans\" are to different ideas, compared to many of us in reality. Lincoln Six Echo questioned, and that was what made the difference. That manner reminded me of Dead Poets Society, another good movie.Needless to say, Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson complemented each other well. This is the first time I watched Johansson in action, and I must say, her character development as Jordan Two Delta was good. It was more noticeable than McGregor's part. Lincoln Six Echo was depicted as a skeptic to start with, whereas Jordan Two Delta was very innocent. On the other hand, I was quite surprised that McGregor took up this role as I was quite brainwashed with his role as Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars and Catcher Block in Down With Love. After all, Lincoln Six Echo is more of a character of innocence, curiosity, and mischief, just like a confused child. Nevertheless, it was a refreshing brilliant performance of McGregor.If I were to complain about anything at all, it would be that I didn't manage to buy popcorn because of the long line at the food counter. I don't think people who are just looking for entertainment with depth would complain about this movie.In conclusion, I definitely want to watch this again.","rw1134661","This movie is more than an island of questions.","blackorient",0],[["1","2"],"A Walk to Remember (2002)","10","25 July 2005","I think this movie is such a beautiful story about two people's love for each other.

Many movies has the same story only with some differences, but not this one. This movie has it's own story.

Diane Lane is very convincing in her role as a beautiful divorced woman who is not sure what her next step in life should be. John Cusack's role seems to be one that he has played many times; that of the man in love with the perfect woman who has bad luck.(Serendipity, Hot Pursuit) His character is not as developed as Lane's is. The film lets you get to know Lane's character but Cusack's character leaves a few questions like how does he pay his bills?

I have had the DVD for a while and watched the film several times before now deciding to write and appreciation of it on IMDb. My conclusion after repeated viewings is that this film is one of THE most romantic films made in the present day. Not crude, vulgar and boring sex scenes, but real love, real passion, complicity, awkwardness of people to show their love but LOVE without the shadow of a doubt !I used to think the film was too slow, with time I now find that this is not the case, of course the haunting theme music and thoughtful filming of coastal scenes made an impression on me from the outset but on my first viewing it did seem to drag a bit and appear overlong. I now change my appreciation of that point. Paul Newman's role is funny and touching and he really is an integral part of the film, Robin Wright was absolutely perfect ( I'm not usually in to tall lanky blondes but make an exception in this case !! ) - her composition was absolutely perfect and Iloved her accent which, for me at least, seem to have just the right tone for a lady in love. As to Kevin Costner, I do wish he could have been a little more aggressively passionate at times to respond to Robin Wright, but this criticism seems to diminish the more I watch it.Nowadays snobbish cinema critics consider a film is not good if it has a happy ending and therefore by definition a good film would need to have a bad ending. Too many people criticise the \"candy coated\" ending to films. Well, why shouldn't they have a happy ending, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that and I consider that kind of film critic to be an inverted snob ! Whatever the ending of \"Message in a Bottle\" ( I will not speak of it here ), this is truly a very good film. If the evolution of my own appreciation is anything to go by I think that with time the film will GROW in importance and stature, just like certain films considered uninteresting at the time of their issue are now considered as veritable masterpieces. This is one of those.

The innocence and wonder that he expresses as Lincoln 6 Echo was the best I've seen from him.I'll admit that the first half of the movie is better than the 2nd half, and the many chase scenes can get frustrating, but the action adds a lot to the movie, and the directing is wonderful.But the one point that this movie tackled which makes it noteworthy is the characterization. I really cared for the two lead characters and wanted to see them succeed in their goal, which is rare in most action films. I even enjoyed seeing the minor characters through the movie, so much that I cared about their outcomes. Not to mention that they are believable. The main character in this film isn't some invulnerable super action hero, he is frail and inexperienced when it comes to fighting. There weren't any moments that I thought he was going out of his capabilities. The characters are confused and weak, and they are depicted wonderfully.Come on people, stop obsessing over the frat comedies, crappy comic-book adaptations, and dumb horror movies, and treat yourself to a good film.

Being body guards, bounty hunting, name the price and they do it as long as it appears to be on the up and up.

I think director Martin Scorsese did an amazing job of showcasing Howard Hughes life as a Hollywood filmmaker and Aviation pioneer. Every once in a while during the viewing of this film I felt as if I hadn't really accomplished anything in life. Hughes lived such a fascinating life compared to that of an average Joe. It is really kind of sad that his phobias got the best of him and he spend the final two decades of his life in isolation. Who knows what he could have accomplished.As for the performances, they were all amazing. I have never really been a fan of Leo, but I was really impressed with his performance. It was amazing. And the technical team was as impressive. The production design, costumes, cinematography, editing, etc, were all at top level.

A lot of things, such as lightsabers and mind tricks, are not explained and may confuse people. Second is acting. I actually don't see too much wrong with this, but here and there Jake Lloyd delivers a bad line, as well as his friends and such. Third is the corny parts. Examples are JarJar's battle scene and a bit of Anakin flying his starfighter to save the day.

Some people compare it to The Shining. There is even the obligatory overhead shot referring to this movie. But they are worlds apart. This is so lazy and unimaginative in its execution that it is hardly lifted above the average. The house offered many possibilities to explore as a character (with its ghosts) but all the shots in and around the house are without any imagination. As Chelsea enters the roof there are few shots suggesting depth. As the ghosts are shown, they have almost no dramatic impact on the viewer. The transformation of George the father is not very insightful portrayed for the viewer: He turns from father to maniac in an instant and that's not very plausible. A plot twist could have helped the movie regain some interest half-way (e.g. George non-existent but only imagined, George a reincarnation of the original killer). But we are served a simple explanation (why has there to be one at all and why that simple?).Horror movies go through a difficult period. There is an audience out there, but we need more creativity from the people who make them.

Of course you must ignore the fact Reggie tossed that shotgun in the first one and now he has it and Jody is played by a different guy, other than that I can roll with it. A bit to much humor is used in this one too, as this also takes away from the movie's spookiness as well.

While, all this is happening a psychopath (Stephen Rae) is kidnapping girls and torturing them live on the net. So, is there any connection between the two activities?

Elements from other (better) films show up and you just can't deny it or even forgive it for being uninspiring. Though, actually I didn't hate it, but I could've gone without seeing it. The premise starts off pretty interesting, but after that it just fizzles out. It just becomes tiresome and rather dull story telling, with uninspired performances from the leads that aren't capable of carrying a film and are hardly convincing in their roles. The plot doesn't make too much sense, with pointless subplots and no real cohesion. It does get very muddled with its ridiculous outcomes and it focusing on sequences that are full of tedium. When it reaches the pointless ending you'll think why did I bother? Not much of a mystery is achieved as no tension, atmosphere and detail is built. It basically rips off the plot of \"Ringu/The Ring\". Instead of a video it's now a haunted Website. You can also throw in ideas from \"Videodrome\" (the better of the three) into the mix. The script is fairly mortifying, with such trite dialogue coming out of the their mouths. The screenplay is plain unexciting and ineffective. Performances from the likes of Stephen Dorff, Natascha McElhone and Stephen Rae were by the numbers. They were just so uninteresting and unbelievable that you just didn't care for them. Look out for a small cameo from Jeffery Combs (Re-animator and From Beyond). What the film went for was slick visuals, potent camera-work and flashy editing. Visually it was good, though towards the end the whole treatment did kind of get annoying and incredibly repetitious. The look of the film was incredibly dark, with many gloomy sequences involving dimly lit corridors and rooms. Even the sombre mood or fine score couldn't help it raise any chills.

And, going to confession doesn't count either. It's what you do in your everyday life that counts. God watches you in your everyday life and keeps a record of what you do. That is basically the message Martin Scorsese is trying to get across. In a way I sort of agree with him.Before Scorsese decided to become a filmmaker he thought about becoming a priest. So, because of that fact we can conclude that religion is a big part of his life. And a big part of this film as well. As an early effort he is making something a little more personal, since his previous film, Boxcar Bertha, didn't really do anything.I applaud the film for being what it is and I love every moment in this film.

It is a live performance, with all the drawbacks that that entails - some singers are less audible from certain positions on-stage, but there is a lot of movement, so such a problem tends to be short-lived. The moving about can occasionally get noisy, too - characters stepping on and off the raised stage almost always make a loud thump, perhaps because microphones were located near the front - I seldom noticed it if people were walking around in the background. The sets are a bit goofy, but bright-colored and amusing; the chairs look particularly uncomfortable.For the most part the singing is quite good - Raimondi, who is by far the best actor, has a nice strong voice as Selim, and can sing as fast as anyone. The duet between Selim and Don Geronio in Act II, which culminates in a blistering patter song as the two threaten to murder each other, is the highlight of the opera. Paolo Rumetz is good as Don Geronio, though I think that maybe the role was originally intended for an older man - I get the impression that Geronio and Fiorilla are supposed to be a ridiculous May/December mismatch, with a feeble old man unable to control his young, lively wife. Still, this Geronio may not be old, but he does come across as a perpetually fogged simpleton, yet kind-hearted enough not to lose the audience's sympathy. Cecilia Bartoli is a fine singer, but her Fiorilla seems so much tougher than Geronio that it's hard not to feel sorry for him. I think she might be trying too hard to be brilliant and fascinating - her singing part is a difficult one, so she's got a lot to handle, but her facial contortions can be a bit off-putting. She might have done better just to relax and sing instead of trying to act so much. Reinaldo Macias is not the strongest tenor I've heard, but he's not a bad actor, and he bears an astonishing resemblance to a young Jean-François Balmer. It's quite delightful to see him simply lapse into bliss every time he catches sight of his own reflection in the polished knob of his fancy walking stick.

They are great actors and we lap them up on screen. Funny, though, I rented this because Saeed Jaffrey was in it playing \"Billy Fish.\" I enjoyed watching Saeed in the Merchant-Ivory pictures and in the British thriller \"Killing Kind,\" and in the new pyx w/ Burt Reynolds set in Amsterdam called \"Snapshots.\" These guys have such appealing chutzpah together and twinkle along with preposterous schemes and grandiose impulses, and they have a kind of honor about friendship and loyalty. Guided by a lot of luck, they do manage to take over leadership of a small, devout country that accepts the Masonic emblem as proof of Connery's Divinity! What a comedic romp this becomes. And Sean, at first Solomon-like in his wisdom,soon becomes tarnished and, with veiled lasciviousness, decides to wed. That sets off the old Dudes who were the Guiding Gurus before Connery got there. Michael Caine should not have stuck around for the wedding. Caine was ready to split because he couldn't stomach the direction Connery was going in, with the Kingship Routine and the hedonism. But Caine DID stick around and when the wedding day dawned, and when the bride BIT Connery and he BLED, well, the Old Dude Gurus gave the go-ahead for the mob of citizenry to give Connery 'what fer.' And they managed to do this. Caine lived thru it all to come back and regale Kipling (what a terrific, never-before-seen job of underplaying a role Chrisopher Plummer did here - he was simply magnificent and I did not recognize the actor in any way/shape/form as accustomed to him by his later roles)with the entire story. This is an original tale. The photography was luscious. It makes you appreciate John Huston's work all the more. Some movie people you just don't wanna see age. And that applies to Caine, Connery, Huston, Plummer, and certainly not the fine Saheed Jaffrey, whose cultured speaking intonations are thrilling to hear and who has aged to perfection, now around 76. I hope the movie-makers will utilize this gentleman in good roles of grace and meaning until he is too old to memorize dialogue! This is a great film for younger people to go back and see.

They tried to tell a balanced view of the tale, by including viewpoints of both white settlers and of the dispossessed Indians. It was a noble effort, and very brave.Sadly, they created an inconsistent, oftentimes disappointing, product.The plot line revolving around the Lakota people was brilliant. The tale of young medicine man Loved by the Buffalo is wonderfully done and completely heart-wrenching. There is a high level of authenticity, plausibility, and interest around these Indians and their families. The saga of the Lakota is the shining spot on this miniseries. I didn't find too much fault with any of the Indian segments of this miniseries, they did justice to Black Kettle and Little Bighorn and the Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee, forming a cohesive and emotional story of the various tribes of natives.It's the stories surrounding the white settlers that are horrible.The primary problem is the obvious desire of the filmmakers to include every major event and icon in Western history into five two-hour episodes. They include Jebediah Smith's quest for the California coast. They include Bleeding Kansas. They include wagon trains. They include blasting railroad tunnels. They include the Golden Spike ceremony. They include the Gold Rush. The include the Pony Express. They include practically every event you could think of into these episodes. This required huge contrivances on the part of the writers. They created a huge family from western Virginia, made them all hungry for adventure, and scattered them throughout every major event whether their presence made sense or not. The main character, Jacob Wheeler (horribly played by Matthew Settle in the beginning, better played as \"old Jacob\" by John Terry), manages to not only make it to California but also marries a Lakota woman, has some kids, abandons his family, becomes a mountain man, joins the army and defeats the Mexicans, pans for gold, rejoins his family, has some more kids, and manages to live an unnatural long life ... very little of which is believable.The secondary problem is the writing. So much of the dialogue is contrived and overdone. Because the producers wanted to include every event, all the actors were forced to read long speeches describing what was going on at that time. Plus they embellished it with so many period colloquialisms it would choke an English major. Made the dialogue more distracting than interesting. This was double jeopardy in the first three episodes where Matthew Settle not only delivers bad dialogue on-screen, but also has to read some of the hokeyness via narration (quite possibly the worst use of narration in any film).There's plenty of lousy acting to be had. The worst by far is the aforementioned Matthew Settle, but there are so many I couldn't possibly count all the bad performances. Again, with dialogue and choices as bad as those mentioned earlier, not too many actors could have pulled it off.Towards the end there is some redemption for this series. The fourth episode, focusing on the Black Kettle massacre, the battle of Little Bighorn, and a moving piece on the forced \"assimilation\" of Indian children into American society, provides some relief from the vapidity of the prior three. And the last episode, focusing on the Ghost Dance and the Wounded Knee massacre, is actually pretty good (until Jacob Wheeler's reappearance to give the stereotypical \"high concept wrap-up\"). So it's not a total loss.But overall they could of, and should of, done a much better job on this miniseries. Thanks to some bad choices this series didn't have a chance, and it really deserved one. I am still convinced the story of the settlement of the West is a story with all the elements of great drama. But with such a bad treatment it'll be some time before anyone attempts to tell it again.5 out of 10.Barky</td><td>rw1133971</td><td>An Uneven Telling of the Story of Western Settlement</td><td>Barky44</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(3, 5)</td><td>Constantine (2005)</td><td>8</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>Chances are they are die-hard fans of the Hellblazer comics/graphic novels.

They found one property, THE GRASS HARP, where they shared one scene together. But then this film was made which was fully their film together. Like most of their films Lemmon is the quiet partner who is dragged into the troublesome situation by the noisy partner Matthau. Here they are brother-in-laws (Matthau's sister, who is dead). Matthau convinces Lemmon that he needs to take a sea cruise to end his long period of mourning. Lemmon does not realize that Matthau got them free passage by signing them onto the cruise as social dancers (partners for elderly lady passengers). Lemmon can dance, but Matthau cannot, and one scene has Lemmon trying to teach Matthau, only to be caught by Donald O'Connor and Hal Linden dancing together (O'Connor and Linden jumping to the wrong conclusion). If they can't pull their weight as social dancers, they will have to pay the $1,500.00 per person fare as travelers. Neither can afford that. Matthau really could not care much about this - he hopes that he will be lucky to find, romance, and marry a wealthy woman. Lemmon is encouraged to do the same, but he is not as mercenary. As it turns out Lemmon does meet Gloria De Haven, and Matthau meets Dyan Cannon (and her mother, Elaine Stritch). But the course to true love is never smooth in movies. Matthau has a rival for Cannon, in Edward Mulhare. And Brent Spiner, the cruise entertainment director, is an evil martinet determined to impress the cruise line owner (Rue McLanahan) to put him in control of all the cruise ship's entertainment centers.It is a well-cast film, which helps (this is reminiscent of the two \"Grumpies\" films that preceded it. But those films had better balance to them. They had moments of pathos where one could see Lemmon and Matthau were not just funny men but human types. Here Lemmon is shown to have such a weakness - he has romanced De Haven in spite of his qualms, but at a critical point remembers his deep love for his first wife. But Matthau's personality is so mercenary (a \"cousin\" to his \"Whiplash Willie Gingrich\" in THE FORTUNE COOKIE), that his turning into a legitimate lover of Cannon doesn't quite sit well. Nor does it sit well when we find other likable characters can be equally mercenary.However there are plenty of great moments in the film. Spiner's unplanned involvement with a colorful local parade is one. So is Matthau's ridiculous dance with Rue McLanahan that looks atrocious (he calls his non-steps, \"the crawl\")but that she enjoys. Spiner, better known as \"Mr. Data\" the android in STAR TREK, THE NEXT GENERATION, turns in a fine comic villain performance. My only criticism is that Linden and O'Connor seem too peripheral in the plot (although both do give filler about the ruthlessness of Spiner, whom Linden really dislikes). But the film is still very amusing, and worth while seeing. Unfortunately it was not their final film. That would be THE ODD COUPLE II.</td><td>rw1133973</td><td>Amusing Follow Up to the Two \"Grumpies\"</td><td>theowinthrop</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 5)</td><td>War of the Worlds (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>This movie was really good!

This is a character and film with a lot of hate. Some consider Bickle to be a loner, but sometimes he appears to be a man with a lot hatred to his surroundings. Could it be a political or social statement by Scorsese? Or perhaps that Paul Schrader was going through depression when he wrote the script? Whatever the answer might be, all I can say is that this is a very powerful film. If you are like me when this film is over your mouth will be wide open. Bickle (in a perfect performance by Robert De Niro) is a scary character. Although his motives are positive (sometimes) the way he gets results is a little extreme. Then again it was the '70s.

To me, the Osmonds were, are, and shall always be, the best entertainers on the planet. (I emphasize the word \"entertainment\" over \"music\" in this case.) So the music wasn't always the best. So the jokes were often lame. So \"squeaky-clean\" wasn't everybody's thing. THAT DOES NOT MEAN EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HATES THE SHOW! As far as my family and I were concerned, \"squeaky clean\" was in. We never had to worry about the show being offensive or risqué. Choosing \"Donny & Marie\" on weekends was a no-brainer. No matter how silly or over-the-top things got, it took us out of ourselves and made us forget our troubles for one hour every week.

I enjoyed the humor, the songs, the guest stars, the Krofft puppets, even the cross-references to other period shows.Compared to today's lame-brained comic fare, this series is truly a lost gem that deserves rediscovery. (As I recall, one night in 1993, Nick at Nite did air a New Year's Eve episode of the show, but they aired it only once. Maybe they thought no one was watching. They were wrong. I was.) If Nick at Nite, TV Land, or even Goodlife TV won't put it back on the air, at least put it out on DVD. I rank this show right up there with other classic variety shows like \"Lawrence Welk,\"\"Ed Sullivan,\" \"Sha-Na-Na,\" \"Carol Burnett & Friends,\" Flip Wilson,\" and \"Tony Orlando & Dawn.\" (Believe it or not, \"Sonny & Cher\" never appealed much to me.

It happens that \"An Affair To Remember\" has something more to offer than tears. To borrow a sci-fi cliché, this one has the force with it. This film alone has star power far exceeding that of a planet-full of today's motion pictures.No wonder it is considered one of the best romantic dramas of all times. When American film Institue made their \"100 years, 100 Passions\" list, \"An Affair To Remember\" was at a fifth place, with only \"Casablanca\", \"Gone With The Wind\", \"West Side Story\", and \"Roman Hoiday\" ahead.Some of film's glorious moments leave indelible impression. Cary Grant waiting on th 102 nd. floor for Deborah Kerr to appear is one such scene. This is part of the movie's charm that it has inspired generations of film-lovers. To the extent that some film-makers have actually used it as a super-plot. By inter-wining their own stories with this classic tale of love, by downloading some of its atmospheres in their stories, formula film-makers have tried lending some more depth and charm to their otherwise mundane plots.

It's tough to create the foreboding atmosphere a good horror movie needs on videotape without resorting to photographic effects that make it look like a \"Dr. Who\" episode from the 1970s.

It also dealt with two beautiful women. \"Persona\" is a film that kept me glued to the screen. It has to be Ingmar Bergman's best film. I'm not just saying that because every critic has said that since the mid sixties. I'm saying that because it is a surreal mind puzzle that made me dive into my subconscious. \"Persona\" is filmed in gorgeous black and white and at an 85 minute running time it never wears out it's welcome. The montage in the beginning is sooooooooo bizarre, don't sit to close to the screen you might hallucinate. The story concerns Alma (Bibi Anderson), a nurse who is taking care of Elizabeth, played mysteriously by the sexy Liv Ullman. Elisabeth refuses to speak, she stopped talking in the middle of a play. For some reason Alma feels very comfortable around her and starts to tell her personal things. She even moves in with Elisabeth to help out. Alma explicitly talks about a sexual escapade that her and her friend experienced on the beach. The scene shows nothing sexual, but the vivid language and sexy Swedish dialog turns this moment into one of the hottest most arousing scenes in cinema history. (something almost popped up for me... spring-boing!!!) Elisabeth still remains silent. There characters eventually merge as one person. Alma also finds out that Elisabeth has betrayed her when she reads a letter she wrote telling a friend about her personal intimate secrets. Oh no! This is when the film turns into a crazed decent into madness as only Bergman could bring you. He even films one scene twice but at a different angle. Now if only Bergman was more optimistic; poor guy. All kidding aside, Persona is an amazing experience that breaks the fourth wall between film and reality. Images are only representational of life, Bergman shows viewers this as the camera runs out of film. This is just my interpretation. Oh heck, I think I'll have two watch this a couple more times, and not just for the explicit conversation about Alma's orgasms. I think both \"Persona\" and \"Muholland Drive\" would make a great double feature. I don't think there is any film that is like \"Persona\". In fact there probably never will be.

Great comic Lily Tomlin is wealthy Edwina Cutwater, sickly and seemingly on the verge of death. Roger is dispatched to take care of changing Edwina's will. She doesn't want to die, so has employed the services of a 'swammi' who will transfer her soul to this little silver bucket at the moment of her death, and then it will be transferred to the body of young and very pretty Terry (Victoria Tennant), at the same time freeing Terry's soul to the universe. To make it work, Edwina must change her will so that she (in the form of Terry) can retain her own wealth.SPOILERS. Of course Roger doesn't believe any of this and, in a huff, walks out of the meeting and onto the street one floor below. As Edwina has an attack, her soul is transferred to the silver bucket, which is accidentally knocked out the window, onto Roger below, and now there are two people in this body, Roger and Edwina, each controlling half the body. Which brings up some very funny situations and Steve Martin's adept physical comedy is much fun to watch. In a mirror he sees her reflection, and in this way can have \"face to face\" conversations. This is also a way to tell, by Roger's looking into a mirror, if Edwina is still there.MORE SPOILERS. Eventually Edwina's soul is put back into the bucket, after a couple of other \"transfers\", it is put into Terry, and Terry's soul goes into a white horse that her father takes care of as stable man.

I finally did come upon it again today and popped it in my VCR. I wasn't expecting anything great. I had heard that is was an overly soap opera-ish mess. I was happily proved wrong.The movie begins with Alec Walker, a man who is unhappily married and Julie Eden, a widow with a young daughter. They meet while Julie is \"fishing\" and they fell in love. When Alec gets into a car crash outside of Julie's house, his wife, Maida, finds Julies sketchbook that Alec had borrowed. Maida assumes that the two were out on a date together, which is untrue.Alec asks his wife for a divorce, but Maida refuses to go to Reno to get one and thinks that going to Paris along with Alec's parents would be best. While Maida is away Alec buys Julie a house and they are anxiously awaiting the day they can be married. Maida on the other hand refuses to let Alec go and runs in to numerous \"difficulties\" while in Paris. Therefore Alec never gets his divorce. Time passes and Julie becomes more and more discouraged, thinking that this will never work out.Ill stop here so I don't give more away.

Time Burton phenomenally directs this movie with amazing sets and design. The world of the chocolate factory is breath-taking. The amazing contrast between the drab city and the vibrant factory is one of the many stunning visual effects.The children in this movie are back with just as terrible, if not more so, personalities. Charlie is also extremely well played and fully portrays the Charlie from before.The main difference in Tim Burton's version is Depp's idea of Wonka. Wilder makes Wonka out to be a cynical and tormented man. Depp describes Wonka as a child who only grew in physical size. He constantly swings from a serious tone to bitterly sarcastic to completely delusional. His character mirrors that of a child forced to live as an adult. Many people have compared this portrayal of Wonka to Michael Jackson. This comparison has some merit as both seem to be trapped in their childhood, but this does not demerit the performance at all. Just because such a likeness exist does not mean the Willy Wonka should not have been played as such.Tim Burton also fleshes out the movie by adding the background of Wonka and a short segment about the history behind the Oompa Loompas. Wonka's twisted beginnings truly demonstrate why he has turned into such a clash between childhood and adulthood.Another addition of Tim Burton are the new songs for the Oompa Loompas. Instead of the stagnant tunes from \"Willy Wonka and the Chocalate Factory\", multiple short songs from various genres are played. All completely choreographed to fit with the genre, these scenes are a great laugh for those who have seen the original.*SPOILIER START* Tim Burton even injects a very funny exchange of dialogue criticizing who the dance and song by the Oompa Loompas seems setup and planned.*SPOILER END*This movie is an excellent view and I completely recommend seeing it. It provides a much fuller movie experience and covers the background and explains the future of Charlie; this is a large bonus as the original lacked any background or future. If I could I would give the movie 9.5 out of 10 because there were only a few points where the movie could have been slightly tweaked. The scene where Charly brings home the ticket just seemed to have some awkward dialogue. But by these ratings I will give it a 9, because 10 is reserved for perfection.To reiterate, this movie is a great new experience even for those who have seen the original. But if you are just looking for a new version with revamped visuals, don't waste your money. Compared to the original, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is an amazing experience, surpassing the original as an entire movie.</td><td>rw1133994</td><td>An Amazing Movie; More than a Recreation</td><td>nopurpose229</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(5, 8)</td><td>Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe (1990)</td><td>8</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>For those certain people who thought it took place in space, should have read the back of the box.

This is partly because it still pokes fun at those people you should be accepting, but mostly because it has a big, big heart.I'm not a soppy person by nature, but I really loved this movie. It shone out like a gem in a sea of recent dross. I liked the fact that despite his flaws, Hal was a decent guy, and his actions in the children's hospital the final time only served to prove it.If there was one thing that did somewhat undermine its ultimate moral, it was the fact that the big gal who is the object o Hal's affections, is in fact played by stick-insect Paltrow in a fat suit. Made in America; a country where gross obesity seems to be a national pass-time, I find it impossible to believe that they couldn't find a suitable actress. Perhaps, despite the upbeat message of acceptance, the Farrely's thought that audiences couldn't stomach a genuine fat person in a the romantic lead?

The problem has a lot to do with director Robert Zemeckis, who reaches for a kind of screwball motor-mouth quality, but ends up steering the project in a needlessly coarse direction. Zemeckis knows how to bring flow to a movie, but his sense of comedy is not very finely-tuned. There's a lot of profanity in the movie, and general vulgarity, and Zemeckis's treatment of this material tends to emphasize its rudeness in the wrong way. He wants to get an Animal House sense of the sophomoric, but he doesn't have the touch necessary to make crudity fun. His characters aren't blissful vulgarians, they're just plain vulgar.The plot is basically an exercise in oneupmanship. Sleazy used car magnate Roy Fuchs wants to force his honest-but-poor brother Luke, also a used car dealer (their lots are right across the street from one another), out of business, thereby rescuing his own place from being demolished to make way for a new freeway ramp. The ruthless Roy hatches a plan to give the ailing Luke a heart attack; after the plan succeeds, Luke's hot-shot salesman, Rudy, takes over running the lot, and begins concocting any number of harebrained schemes in an attempt to defeat Roy, and help his own political ambitions (a politician who's literally a used-car salesman). Matters are complicated by the appearance of Barbara, Luke's long-lost daughter, who must be kept in the dark about her father's fate. There are dashes of satire along the way, little digs at Jimmy Carter and other relevant late-70s matters, but mostly the film is a flat-out farce, an escalating series of bizarre situations. The funniest gag concerns Rudy and his cronies' attempts to get publicity by hi-jacking the air-waves, first during a football game and then during a presidential address. The film is at its most anarchic during these scenes, which inevitably involve strippers and cuss-words, and manages to be sporadically chaotic the rest of the time. A lot of comic energy is spilled by everyone involved, sometimes too much. One big scene involving the salesmen's efforts to exploit their new-found publicity through a sales blitz degenerates into a frantic mess, and the climactic sequence involving 250 cars driven cross-country by student drivers just seems desperate.The only really memorable character in the movie is Rudy, played by Kurt Russell as a slick operator whose breathless selling hides the heart of a decent fellow. Jack Warden plays brothers Roy and Luke as diametric opposites, Roy an evil slime-ball and Luke a grandfatherly coot, and is only really funny when Luke is having a coronary. Deborah Harmon is a little too earnest as Barbara, though her off-beat look does seem right for the character. Where the movie really flops is in the key supporting performances: Gerrit Graham is mediocre as the superstitious Jeff, while Frank McRae edges into an uncomfortable area as the sleepy, foul-mouthed black mechanic Jim. The acting overall lacks the kind of nuance that might have been brought out by a director with more comic feel than Zemeckis. The situations are funny enough, and the writing is passable, but there's a sense to almost every scene that the gags are being overplayed. Zemeckis seems to have pushed the actors to be zanier, and louder, and more profane, when a more low-key approach might have served them better. The situations are outlandish enough that it's not really necessary to sell them much. Zemeckis's approach, however, is to sell everything harder, like he's hawking some old beater instead of a serviceable machine.</td><td>rw1133997</td><td>Over-Revved Car Comedy</td><td>aliasanythingyouwant</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 3)</td><td>Hustle & Flow (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>I thoroughly enjoyed this entrancing and engaging movie ... as did my two hip-hop loving sons, ages 22 and 23, respectively.No stereotypes, just a bunch of complex people with hopes and dreams like every one.

Besides the silly special affects and the strained script, the best part of this SCFI blockbuster is Dakota Fanning. Fanning who's only 11 years old upstages the great Tom Cruise with little trouble.But with this in mind, Spielberg still manages to keep the audience's attention like he's always managed to do.

The characters are disconnected, and oddly intertwined. This film felt like a guilty pleasure and sitting next to my wife who didn't laugh once made me feel all the more guilty. What punctuates these uncomfortable moments with the kid's scenes are the adult's scenes - - these adults seem more like children. In fact, the naiveté of these adults is really a welcoming thing in this day and age of children growing up so soon. The adults view of the world reminds me of how David Byrne (of Talking Heads/True Stories) perceives the world - \"pieces and parts\" of interest, focusing on minutiae and the everyday \"stuff\", showing the absurd in the ordinary, while never condescending to any character.

This movie made my Sunday evening, and weekend as a whole. I mean, it's not a magnum opus, maybe a little creepy when you come to think of the concept - but the characterization and acting by the leads was just brilliant! Everything was so well crafted that you will exit from the movie theater with a smile. Unless you're weirder than weird, of course.While watching the movie, so many questions arose - Why a Scotsman (McGregor) is made to speak with an American accent? Why is he paired with a lady (Johannsen) 10 years younger to him. Guess what - even these silliest of answers get answered in the end! PROLOGUE: This is not a SPOILER. It's an explanation of how things are before the time-line of the movie begins. The setting is 2019. People have gotten richer, of course technology has advanced drastically, and the concept of cloning does exist. Noted celebrities, politicians, sports-persons desire to live a longer life and a career no matter what has to be done. Thus, there are clones created in a remote institute in Arizona run by an English scientist ,Merrick. Merrick and his staff basically take a complete scan of the client (called the \"investor\") and a clone of the same investor is created with the same physical and anatomical, yet closer to perfect, features. However, these clones, or \"insurance policies\" as they are called, are bred to only be killed eventually for their spare parts - lungs, heart, you name it, to be taken away and given to the investor to live longer. Until their termination time, they are fed on a very strict diet, and are only educated up to the level of a 15 year old. The clones are kept content in their inner lives by being told they were brought to the institute because they were \"contaminated\" in the real world and were getting cured from the same. They were also promised a lottery where a winner gets to go to the \"Island\" - where a new world is set to begin, new breeding, no pollution, etc. This is until a flaw occurs in the habilitation process and one product, Lincoln has questions....----------------------------- Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen were absolutely brilliant in their acting and carried the movie from beginning to the end. I was slightly disappointed when I saw the trailer earlier, and it implied that Scarlett was becoming a blonde bimbo of Hollywood - but I was wrong. She not only had a role to play, but played it well. Hope she becomes the next Hollywood superstar as she is a truly good actress, and charming in her own way.McGregor, on the other hand, carries his post-Star_Wars grace very well, and should be looking for some really dramatic and challenging roles in the near future to get an Oscar or some awards. He is a good actor, and is definitely no James Bond material - too down to earth as an actor (maybe not as a person) to play the cocky British spy. The supporting cast - Michael Clarke Duncan only had a few lines to spare and was a cry baby, but an OK role done. Djimon Honsou - Hollywood's only \"African\" actor played his role well and gracefully. Steve Buscemi is what one could call a struggling actor. I respect him for trying something new like playing a confused ex-con on a full season of the SOPRANOS - showed his less-comedy side which he portrays in Adam Sandler movies. In the Island, he did sort of fit the role of a crazy techie, but he needs to find something that will bring his recognition back up.Sean Bean, the smooth talking, English villain who played a James Bond baddie too early in his career, also carried his vicious role well. Would have been more appropriate to see an American Southerner play the role of the institute's head-honcho as it was set in Arizona. Overall I gave the movie 8/10.

He hoped to, and (probably for the best) a gunshot stopped him. I say probably because there is considerable debate over him to this day.If you love democracy, with a balance of power approach as in the Federal Constitution (or the states for that matter) Long is an evil aberration. He used the normal methods of rising up the political ladder as a state railway commissioner, a state senator, Governor, and U.S. Senator. On his way up he found ways of reducing the opposition to a set of shrill, impotent voices, and of manipulating the state legislature, the judiciary, and the local governments to do what he wanted. For all intents and purposes Louisiana was a dictatorship under Huey. And once he got into the U.S. Senate, he planned to spread his influence until he was in the White House, and could do the same thing there.Therefore, his death by gunshot in the state capital building at Baton Rouge, La. on September 18, 1935, was a lucky break. Whether he was shot by Dr. Carl Austin Weiss (the son-in-law of an opponent who'd been racially smeared by Long) or by a trigger happy guard who was joining in the shooting of Weiss does not matter - he would have been bad news for American Democracy.But here's the problem. Huey did not come from a state that had a history of two party democracy. Most of the states in the south were dominated for decades by the Democratic Party (which was opposed to big business in theory, but also highly racist towards African-Americans and minorities). So when he studied how to get higher in office, he learned how his predecessors did it. He also noted the success of others in other states at turning them into fiefdoms - like Senator Hiram Johnson of California. Secondly, although his methods were crude and resembled fascist or communist models, Huey actually did do a lot of good for his state. One has to study the man's career in light of previous Democrats who were elected to public office. Huey came from the parishes - the back country, and knew the needs of the farmers (both white, Cajun, and black), and how they were neglected in favor of the large cities, particularly New Orleans and Baton Rouge. He was smart, and managed to get a college education, and eventually became a lawyer (a very good one - he actually argued before the U.S. Supreme Court). The Governors and the legislators and the judiciary were extremely conservative (the popular term in use was \"Bourbons\"). Huey, as he built up his machine, delivered services, such as roads and highways and power, to the countryside. He also improved school conditions for the countryside. While still willing to use racial slurs (as with Dr. Weiss's father-in-law) Huey actually got more jobs going for the African-American community. He could also display anti-Semitism when he wished, but when someone pointed out that when he did that he resembled Hitler, Huey became furious: \"Don't ever compare me to that son-of-a-bitch!\", he yelled, \"Every fool whose ever gone against those people has wrecked his state's economy!!\" Not a comment of love, but obviously of sense.Huey was an opportunist. To raise revenues in Louisiana he invited Lucky Luciano to install one armed bandits throughout the state. But he also could sacrifice for reasonable grounds. He signed a law reducing the cotton production from Louisiana to build up prices for the cotton outside the state.So he is not an easy figure to totally condemn or admire. Ken Burns documentary on \"the Kingfish\" (Huey used that name, based on a character on the radio show AMOS AND ANDY, for himself) gives a fairly good balanced view. Burns shows what was frighteningly close to happening, but he does show that Huey was more than a power seeker or a buffoon (as some enemies suggested). While not as detailed as the Burns documentaries on THE CIVIL WAR, JAZZ, or BASEBALL, it is a good place to start studying this remarkable political career.</td><td>rw1134006</td><td>The Kingfish, Warts and Glory</td><td>theowinthrop</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 1)</td><td>Halloween (1978)</td><td>10</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>Halloween was and is my all time horror movie i still watch it and know it by heart I've seen all 8 Halloween movies and wait #9 i always remember when Laurie and Annie where driving in car and don't fear the reaper came on Halloween was a novel before it came out in movie they have to find out why Micheal is the way he is i think that would make a good story for Halloween movie what ever happened to the Strodes Laurie's parents who will Micheal go after now since Laurie strode is dead her son who knows but ill see it Halloween was the beginning of the slasher flicks i think and every holiday started coming out after that and the sequels keep coming theirs Freddy Michael Chucky Jason Leatherface I've only seen one female sleep-away camp but shes really a</td><td>rw1134008</td><td>the night he came home</td><td>meagherdavid</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(3, 8)</td><td>Cannonball Run II (1984)</td><td>9</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>A lot of people who rate movies here are missing the point....The movie stars in this picture rarely saw each other, so I'm sure that making this picture ( and part 1) was as much a social gathering and bunch of fun mixed together.I loved seeing everyone in this film- and am one person who loves the 'fun factor' and could care less about script or technical acting ability of the cast!(below is for the minimum length extension)A lot of people who rate movies here are missing the point....The movie stars in this picture rarely saw each other, so I'm sure that making this picture ( and part 1) was as much a social gathering and bunch of fun mixed together.I loved seeing everyone in this film- and am one person who loves the 'fun factor' and could care less about script or technical acting ability of the cast!</td><td>rw1134009</td><td>Lots of FUN</td><td>bandit44</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 3)</td><td>Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)</td><td>6</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>Director Doug Liman, who's gotten famous for making fun movies like \"Swingers\" and \"Go\" has successfully blended together action and comedy.In \"MR.and Mrs.Smith\" Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt star as John and Jane Smith a mild mannered couple with dark secrets.

But many films such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", \"The English Patient\", and even \"Lord of the Rings\" have lot of silly sentimental corny love story lines but they are much more acclaimed than Titanic. I have a feeling the reason why this film got so much bad rap is that much of the audience are very young females and that their being head-over-heels over DiCaprio annoyed lot of men. (I think DiCaprio DID do a mediocre performance in this movie.)

Production values were outstanding. It seemed relatively slow-moving in terms of plot, more slice of life than fast-paced actions or twists and turns, but there was a real plot. This program was very dark in tone, not because of excessive violence, but because of its portrayal of a criminal subculture where no-one can be trusted or relied upon, where success is fleeting, and where even successes are hollow. Unlike Tarantino's gangster flicks or Japanese yakuza films, there are no amusing quirks of character or cartoonish elements to provide comic relief. The lead character has the expensive cars and clothes, and the trophy wife, but it's still not enough to fulfil his ambitions. His sneer of cold command and chilly, controlling demeanour suggests a total emotional vacuum. His wife can't stand his lifestyle, he doesn't even truly know his best friend, his gang consists of imbeciles and traitors, and the timid Irish accountant that he thinks he controls is actually putting the screws on him. The other gangsters he deals with are similarly disillusioned. One talks of how he hates his kids, another says that to him the 60's meant little fun and a lot of hard work.

The battle scenes were done perfectly, it's worth seeing only if you want to see Achilles(Brad Pitt) fight. Now for the acting: I thought Brad Pitt did an outstanding job as Achilles. It made me feel like he actually Was Achilles. He gave an outstanding performance. People think he is no good and became famous because he is good looking, no,he became famous despite that fact.Another outstanding performance was given by Sean Bean. I don't know why so few even mention him. I would give him an Oscar for the role. He stole the scenes he was in. I couldn't have imagined a better Oddiseyus. I am amazed!Of course we all know who the \"weakest links\" are : Orlando Bloom was just flat, he did nothing with his character and neither did the actress who played Helen.I watched this movie a number of times and the more I watch it the more I get the feeling that some actors are just reciting their lines.On the other hand, the more I watch the movie the more I am amazed by Pitt,Bean. Also I would like to point out the actress who played Brisseis- Rose Byrne. She did a very good job and she is very pretty.:)All I know is everyone sees what they are able to see.

Casting was excellent; Michael Caine as Alfred was inspired, and he plays the part both with charismatic charm and with a deep empathy for Bruce Wayne and his demons. I didn't check out the cast list fully before seeing the movie, and I kept telling myself that the actor playing the young James Gordon looked really familiar... has Gary Oldman ever played a good guy before this? Hopefully they will continue to use him in the sequels (of course there will be those!) so we can see his eventual rise to police commissioner.It was great to see how human the man behind the mask is... that is something that Val Kilmer and George Clooney could not come across with (Michael Keaton did a better job of portraying Bruce Wayne as a tortured soul, but not was well as Bale did).And while I'm not a Bat addict, wasn't one of the villains named \"Scarecrow\" in the comic?

How disappointed I was to find myself waiting for the end of this tedious, hackneyed serial-killer plot. Before long I suspected that Conan Doyle had no connection with this story, apart from the name of the main characters, and from then on it became a game of 'spot the anachronisms', of which there were too many to count. Rupert Everett was okay, I suppose, but the splendid Ian Hart was completely wasted in this production. So unlike the dynamic partnership between Holmes and Waterson in 'Baskervilles'. By the time the story had dribbled to its silly conclusion, I had become convinced that it had originated from a recently written screenplay, so I scrutinised the credits, beginning and end, for any sign of 'Conan Doyle'. No, nothing. Not even a 'Based on characters created by'. I'm surprised that the script was written by the man who did the screenplay for 'Baskervilles'. I would have thought he would have realised that aristocratic girls back then did not 'pass out' but rather fainted. Very disappointing indeed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I will be discussing the winners of the events so don't read this if you don't want to see any spoilers!As usual, things kicked off with the swimming relay. Stepfanie Kramer was holding a very narrow lead for NBC when Mark Harmon buried the competition while swimming the third leg. Victory easily went to NBC in this event.Next up was the kayak race. Tony Danza (ABC Team) lost control of his kayak and went sideways, partially entering the CBS lane. He caused his team to fall quite a bit behind. Luckily, Tracy Scoggins kicked some major butt in the third leg and drove her team to an exciting come from behind victory. The CBS team was a poor sport about the whole thing and actually protested (even though their loss had nothing to do with the Danza fiasco). Sore losers...ABC wins this event.In this part of the broadcast Cosell tactfully interviews Tracy Scoggins and asks her if she is bothered by the fact that people consider her \"just a sexpot; no talent\". Good job for keeping things light Howie! The only full game showed in the football event was the final. NBC won in a very dull game 9-5. Mr. Cosell opened up his big mouth again when Jennifer O'Neill was injured in a qualifying match. He stated that everyone is familiar with the problems that she has endured over the years. However, \"in good taste does not want to discuss them in detail\". That's you Howie...a really classy guy brimming with good taste!Baseball dunk was next and Tony Lo Bianco's 3-for-3 performance led ABC to victory. Branda Vaccaro, noticeably absent from other events, took what seemed like a million years to get herself seated in the dunk tank. Everyone found it hilarious. Hmmm.The obstacle course was highlighted by Tracy Scoggins defeating Kim Fields twice and Harmon dominating the men's side of things. He easily defeated a klutzy Tony Danza in the final (he messed up twice).The tandem bicycle relay had NBC and ABC battling it out. That is until Tony Lo Bianco lost his footing and Mark Harmon (with Jane Badler) showed his athletic prowess yet again. Another event won by NBC.That set up a disappointing Tug of War final between NBC and ABC. It lasted under a minute and was predictably dominated by NBC. So there you have it.

What a phenomenally amazing movie!!! I have long been a fan of the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and the first \"Willy Wonka\" movie. That being said, I must say that I enjoyed \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" twice as much as the 1971 version. To begin with, the current version is more visually appealing. The sets were bright and colorful, and more in line with what you might expect from a reclusive genius' workplace. I loved the back story explaining Willy's great love for chocolate and why he was so determined to make it big in the chocolate business. But all of that would be meaningless if the acting was less than great. Fortunately, all of the performances were tremendous!!!! No kidding!!!! Every single one, from Charlie's bed-ridden grandparents to the chocolate master himself. Most notably, Freddie Highmore was cute as a button from his mud spattered high-water pants to his adorable dimpled cheeks. He brought a purity and innocence to his role that was very genuine. All of the other kids were deliciously annoying, as were their parents, which made you realize why the kids were so disgustingly bratty. The oompa-loompas were a scream, and I thought replicating one person to portray lots of oompa-loompas was a very clever and creative touch. The musical numbers were hilarious, without the in your face moralism of the 1971 variety. But I save my greatest praise for Willy Wonka himself, the truly great Johnny Depp. I know he seemed a little creepy, but wouldn't anyone be after being alone in a chocolate factory for 15 years with nothing but oompa-loompas for company?!!? Johnny Depp provided just the right amount of weirdness and sensitivity to the role and has proved himself again to be one of the greatest actors of our time. Mr. Depp never disappoints!!! This movie was a treat for so many reasons. I was very happy to see that Tim Burton toned down the tunnel ride.

Listen to the narrator in the prologue as he tells of the history of the ring and Gollum. That alone is so much more poignant and emotional than 99% of the acting,and I use the term loosely for Liv Tyler and Sean Astin, etc., in the Jackson films.(Which I did like, by the way, I just didn't love those films)John Hurt is great as Aragorn, as are the other voices, and the animation, though extraordinarily trippy, creates a dark foreboding mood.One of the most important differences between the films as well, is that in the Bakshi version Gandalf is portrayed as wise, cunning, and almost having an incredible influence and hand in all of the actions of Middle Earth. The Gandalf in the Jackson films, though played by an excellent actor in Ian Mckellan was cast as a dottering old man who bumped into things and did not have the foresight and all encompassing breadth of vision that the Bakshi Gandalf did.Also, the Balrog in the Bakshi and Jackson versions serves as a microcosm of why the Bakshi version works on a more mystical level. In the Jackson version, the Balrog looks like a CGI ridden, no personality, bull faced, not realistic thing from a Godzilla movie. The one in the Bakshi version, though not as done with effects, has much more of a depth of character, and it exists as a realistic villain rather than Gigan, Mothra, etc.The score in the Bakshi version is infinitely superior to the Enyaesque stylings of Jackson. I mean, when you are watching the Bakshi version the score sways and segways the film, whereas the feeling during the Jackson films is; okay I am sitting in a theater watching this,and now they are playing Enya over it.All in all, despite the MANY things Jackson got right, and the many things he got wrong, the Bakshi version succeeds where the Jackson version does not in the most important and, in the end, vital way.

Wilson's character seems the more typical, with Vaughn having more original bits to his character. As others have said, Vaughn's performance is not to be missed. The constant analysis of situations with reference to the \"rules\" is funny in part because of the truth contained in them and the perceptiveness of the characters, even though their goals are superficial.The supporting cast is great. It has been said before, but \"when Christopher Walken is the most sane character . . . .\" The younger sister and the brother are scene stealers. The interplay between the younger brother and the Vaughn is original and sidesplitting.Overall lots of fun. Worth the price of admission.

What I mean is that the movie focuses more on a small group of men and their fears and problems than it does on a grand plan for Allied victory. It's a very personal movie. We get to see these men up-close and we begin to develop feelings for them. I wouldn't doubt that this is one of the first films to show a U.S. Lieutenant so battle scarred that he resorts to using pain killers just to function. Unlike other war films of this era, not all of these men are going to make it to the end. War is like that. It doesn't pick and chose people to live because we like them. So in that regard, it's also more realistic than some other war movies made in the 50s.To succeed as a small, personal war movie as I've described, the cast has to be able to act. This cast does not disappoint. Richard Widmark, Jack Webb, and Karl Malden are all excellent in their respective roles. I was especially impressed with Webb who has an acting style that can grate on the nerves. He's more subdued here and it works. But as good as these three are, Jack Palance is the highlight of the movie for me. He was undoubtedly the most believable. I could really picture him doing the things in real life that were called for in the script.I have no difficulty recommending Halls of Montezuma to fans of war films.

It's difficult to understand how the man who gave us the charm of E.T. and the humanity of Close Encounters could deliver such pathetic junk. The biggest problem in this film is a script so lacking in coherency that it's writing seems better suited to one of those bad 50's B sci-fi movies. (I think I just heard H. G. Wells roll around in his grave for the umpteenth time.)The other big problem is the lack of empathy one feels for the characters. Cruise's daughter is so annoying I almost wished one of the tripods would put that screeching presence out of her misery. And what's with Tim Robbins? His hammy performance was the only true bit of humor to be found anywhere.Granted, the special effects are great and one should not expect any big statement on the human condition from big budget sci-fi, but we're talking Spielberg here. One anticipates not only a good show but a superior narrative from a good storyteller. On the positive side, the director goes for a much grittier look (a la Saving Private Ryan) which is appropriate for the subject matter. However, maybe the movie would have worked better had it expanded the story to involve more characters and encompassed more the broader effect of the invasion outside of Cruise's family.All in all, a total waste of talent and an even clunkier mess than the marauding invading aliens.</td><td>rw1134034</td><td>E.T.

It was actually the first attempt to present a more realistic view -- albeit by white men -- of the \"human element\" in what had been built up to outlandishly perverted stereotypes about Black people, and the projects. There were definitely stereotypes and caricatures in this series as there were in all sitcoms that had any aspirations of getting past their pilot episode.The cons were actually pretty minimal given the fact that no matter what was presented to the white public there was always going to be a twisting of what the actors and writers were attempting to convey, mostly because of a combination of ignorance and bigotry. It was a no-win situation, and personally I couldn't possibly have cared less what white people got out of the show. If I'm not mistaken, there was a much much larger white following of The Cosby Show than there was for Good Times. And we'll just attribute that to the \"comfort factor.\" The reality is that a whole lot of folks all across the country living in ghettos and projects are hard-working, law-abiding, church/mosque-going people who are committed to family. And yeah there's also crime. Anywhere you pile people on top of each other in crappy situations you're going to see crime.JJ was a caricature but he was also a very talented artist.James Sr. was a loving husband and father and a strong, intense, proud Black man. The fact that he threatened (but never followed through) is part of a language difference; too bad some folks couldn't see the overall makeup of this character as a loving, supportive father and husband. He was also a dark-skinned, African-featured actor in a positive role, and I'm frankly impressed they didn't cast someone with more \"palatable\" features for the white audience (you know, Harry Belafonte or goofy non-threatening faces like Bill Cosby).Florida was a full-figured, dark-skinned, African-featured woman who was depicted as an intelligent, strong, attractive, complex, and desirable WOMAN, which was most definitely a first in what had been and would continue to be the old plantation standard of beauty and the narrow role assignments generally given to women of Esther Rolle's stature.I'm still laughing about the comment that Thelma dressed like a slut! Hah! She dressed like a frickin' school teacher for ...well, any decade from the 60's to now.Many of the political commentary that was slipped in was done around Michael's dialogue with other characters, and usually it was done well.Bookman was a casualty of bad writing and a sloppy solution to a consistent antagonist. You could probably blame Jay Leno if you wanted. He and David Letterman were writers for the show, if memory serves.All in all there were positive messages within the body of the series and the character-driven episodes, and they were able to universalize many aspects of daily life and the nuclear - and extended - family.Of course there was offensive stuff in it too. There's no possible way to get everything right, please everybody, or avoid insulting somebody along the way.

There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it can't be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter doesn't know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it's still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he's just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.</td><td>rw1134042</td><td>The Origin of Horror</td><td>moviemanMA</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 4)</td><td>Sideways (2004)</td><td>10</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>I have seen all the big movies of 2004 now and I am convinced this one is the best, and an all-time excellent piece off work.

They say that comedy is harder than drama. How about a combination of comedy and drama that really works? How about such a combination, where the lead characters are not very attractive? Giamatti is excellent, but so is Clark. Lots of acting with little glances and subtle body movements. Madsen is perfectly cast and her character well-played. Many find that the interaction between Miles and Maya is not credible. It seems to me that Maya and Miles are both more than deep enough for this to resemble real life more than the movies.This may not be the most profound movie ever made, and it may not advance movie-making on a technical or technique level, but this is a very good film, all around.</td><td>rw1134043</td><td>Best of 2004</td><td>cstrother-1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 3)</td><td>The Ladykillers (1955)</td><td>10</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>A long, long time ago (actually, only half a century ago) in a galaxy far, far away (okay, it was in this galaxy, on this planet), Obi Wan Kenobi was known as Alec Guinness, and he made some great movies, including \"The Ladykillers\".

I had to run the gauntlet of a bunch of bleating, ill-informed animal activists who were making false claims that the organisers of the film festival were supporting a 'cat snuff film'. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is NOT a 'cat snuff film' - such claims would be laughable if they were not completely ridiculous and untrue.I find such premature condemnation irritating in the extreme. It is as clear as there is a nose of your face that the people so strongly opposed to this documentary have not a single clue as to what it actually contains. It does NOT contain the graphic components of the cat killing film in question. It does feature, however, a detailed and confronting written description of the film's content, by way of a written scroll giving a minute-by-minute description of its content. The audience is thankfully spared the real footage of the crime.Casuistry: The Art of Killing a Cat is a documentary, pure and simple - and I found it a very well balanced and objective one for that matter. It was very thought provoking. It features interviews with the cat killing criminals, as well as animal activists and an investigating policeman, among many others. It also highlights the killer's defence that it was some sort of 'work of art', especially given that one of them had previously made other films depicting animal cruelty in the name of 'art'.There is some footage of one of the killer's earlier film 'art' works, including dancing with the corpse of a pig obtained from an abattoir, and a peculiar music video featuring dancing skinned animals from a research laboratory. Perhaps the most confronting was the short depiction of the beheading of a small live chicken. All of this imagery was presented in context, and was neither condoning the acts, nor suggestive of such inclusions as being some form of entertainment. It was featured in this documentary to balance out the killer's argument that the filming of the cat's torture was not a precedent setter, but one that had occurred within the context of his previous 'art works' - a nonsense argument in my opinion.As a viewer, I was left feeling a sense of scorn and pity upon the perpetrators of this act - one of whom seemed to frequent minimise the severity of it, with lines of argument such as: \"well, we were drugged out\" and \"we kill animals for meat, so what's the problem\". They seemed mainly well spoken and articulate individuals, but ones that seemed to lack a sense of morality, consequence, responsibility and a honed capacity for knowing when to draw the line with certain reasonable or acceptable behaviours. I think most reasonable adults would agree that the deliberate infliction of real pain on human or animal, regardless of intent, is a tad bit intolerable.Speaking of what is intolerable, the session I attended contained a hefty presence of police and security personnel, after the cinema received some veiled threats. If animal activists think that threatening innocent cinema-goers - who are merely exercising their right to see what they wish - somehow increases the validity of their arguments, then they are sorely misguided and utterly deluded.</td><td>rw1134045</td><td>I cannot see what all the fuss is about...</td><td>johnnycourageous</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(10, 10)</td><td>One of My Wives Is Missing (1976 TV Movie)</td><td>10</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>I saw this movie several years ago and I never forgot it.

You might be tempted to walk out in the first 20 minutes, which seem artless and aimless: not very fascinating people making not very fascinating small talk in drab settings. The by-default protagonist, Marnie (Kate Dollenmayer), is a listless 23-year-old between jobs and quietly smitten with an old friend, Alex (Christian Rudder), who has just broken up with his girlfriend. Does Alex like her? Other friends, among them Alex's sister, don't quite know. Alex, it seems, doesn't quite know. Marnie doesn't communicate her affections very forcefully. In fact, she does nothing very forcefully. She drinks a little at parties, she lies around, she hangs out with laid-back friends, and she floats.Floating, indecision, the indefinite: This is the gray arena of Funny Ha Ha. The surprise is how the movie comes together and gets under your skin before you even know why you should give a damn. What seems improvised and random turns out to be controlled, at times cunningly shaped, and the surface of nonsequiturs and random shrugs conceals fairly intense emotionsthe emotions of self-consciously cool, easy, inarticulate people afraid to pin anything down. The nonaction is set (in what appears to be Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville) in midsummer and has a midsummer formlessnessan extension of the kind of languor you feel in those hazy dog days before the sudden hardness and definition of fall.Dollenmayer becomes more and more fun to read. A young woman with long limbs and sleepy eyes on a big, open face, she's just the sort of beauty whose self-effacing vibe would make her less than magnetic to really handsome guys and madly irresistible to nerdswho think that maybe, just maybe, they'd have a shot. The one she attracts is played by the director, who makes himself look very unprepossessing, indeed. In fact, he's cringe-worthy. The character he plays, Mitchell, tries to make a virtue of his self-deprecation: Loathing himself is obviously all he has to think about. He's so unappealing that it really would be a sign of self-disrespect for Marnie to go to bed with him. Fortunately, he's too lame even to press his case. But she'd be no better off with adorable Alex, whose boneless diffidence seems increasingly selfish and calculated.Funny Ha Ha is a bit of a stunt. How can intelligent people, even slackers, be this vaporous? No one talks about life, the world, politics, music, moviesanything concrete.

It was much more balanced, non-judgmental and rational than it could have been and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The performances in the movie are good. Sharon Lawrence provides an excellent portrayal of the elder woman and gives her character a unique amount of personality, depth and insight which allows the viewer to feel empathy and perhaps in some cases some sympathy for her point of view and the emotions she is going through. She is also exceedingly beautiful and vivacious and that also gives a realistic dimension to this role. Brian Austin Green is also excellent in the role of Paul –he gives the character enough passion, sensitivity and realism to make you also relate and identify with the feelings and emotions that he is experiencing. The supporting cast is also excellent –with John Getz, Ashleigh Aston Moore and Katie Wright all portraying their characters exceptionally and with perfection. The only disappointing character in my opinion was the character of Paul's mother –somehow her character seemed a bit too flat and one-dimensional. Perhaps this was biased by the fact that I didn't like her character but I still think she could have been handled better The script and dialogue in this movie flow well and avoids the trap evident in a considerable number of telemovies of becoming too clichéd or unrealistic. The issues involved in the movie are discussed and treated in a professional way and the consequences of the actions of all the characters involved are evaluated thoughtfully. I actually sympathized with the teenager and Sharon Lawrence's character here –being attracted to older woman myself –but the movie was wonderful at allowing me to see the other side of the picture. That's what I enjoyed so much about this movie –it didn't seek to pass judgment or editorialize about the actions of the main characters. It just let the story unfold quite close to the way that it probably would have in real life.I was disappointed with the ending of this film –which I won't reveal-but, like an early reviewer here, I agree that many would see it as a logical conclusion.

It's not at all like a modern movie. It has title screens and actors using overly broad gestures and overacting in a nearly comical manner. They also sing in an artificial stylized semi-operatic manner. It combines the style of a silent movie with a stage production of an operetta. It is obviously from another age, but it only takes a few minutes before you accept the strange style and simply relax and enjoy it. The available DVD was obviously made from a print that came from barely salvageable deteriorating celluloid. The video quality is terrible and the sound quality is merely bad. In spite of all these problems, the movie is worth watching over and over. The comic scenes are amusing. The bad editing and overdrawn acting is mildly amusing, too. The music is fabulous and you soon relax and begin to love wallowing in the corn. The plot? Think of it as \"Zorro goes to Morocco\" and it was probably at least some of the inspiration for Superman (hero with a secret identity who wears a red cape, etc.). The 1953 version is more easily available, but much of the music and plot was gutted to try to make it a bit more \"cool\" in 1950's terms. Unfortunately, the sacrifices removed much of what made the original production work musically and emotionally. I prefer the older version and just wish there was a better print available. If you have any interest in classic operetta, this is a \"do not miss\" film. If you have no feeling for such music, you would probably find this a complete waste of time (and earn my sympathy for your inability to appreciate it).</td><td>rw1134052</td><td>From another age - a wonderful wallow</td><td>hwadleigh</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(31, 48)</td><td>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)</td><td>2</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen this year (maybe ever). it seems that lately johnny depp has been exploring his feminine side (see 'pirates') but this is ridiculous!

Gone With the Wind.Mask? Well, Peter Bogdonavich isn't exactly a no-name director. Give him a great screenplay and you might just be surprised. I am no big Cher fan, as applies to her acting, but in my opinion it was her best performance ever. Same with Eric Stoltz (Rocky). Stoltz has been doing his thing for 30 years and I have never seen one of his characters that wasn't believable. The guy is \"uber-talented\" and a true professional. This was tough role. He didn't act from *behind* the mask - he had to act *through* the mask. That requires acting at another level of complexity.Sam Elliot (Gar) was believable for me as Cher's (Florence's)love interest and a biker leader. Some may say that all that biker stuff was over the top. I found it convincing. Bikers can seize on a cause with the jaws of a pit bull and be relentless in their support. This was, to me, a really believable situation.The Diana character (Laura Dern) was very welcome and sweet, but I do have a hard time believing that she had not been exposed to some of the concepts that Rocky worked on with her (colors and shapes). She came across as too smart for this stuff to have been a new concept, especially after seeing her parents, who did not seem to be idiots. At the same time, the parents were TOTALLY unbelievable characters. Their daughter, who they obviously love, has a disability, but they are totally repulsed by Rocky and his. It rarely works this way in real life.I do have to sum up with this: If at the end of the movie you did not cry - with real, liquid tears that you could feel with your hand, then you need to call the police right now and turn yourself in as at least a potential (if not actual) serial killer. Just sit on the steps of the front porch and wait for them to get there. Unless you're a certified something-or-other, is simply NOT POSSIBLE to watch the whole movie, and see the ending scene where Cher comes into Rocky's room after finding out he wasn't at school, and not get swept up into that emotion.</td><td>rw1134064</td><td>A Real Classic</td><td>dtburr</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 5)</td><td>Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914)</td><td>7</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>A series of amusing scenarios that as a feature film don't quite gel: as others have commented here, seeing the same slapstick gags over and over again can get monotonous.

Although modern viewers may come to this film expecting it to be a Chaplin feature (who atypically plays a villain), it is in fact very much Marie Dressler's filmmost of the film's comedy comes from watching the sometimes aggravating but essentially innocent Tillie flailing about like a giant, goggle eyed baby as she tries to cope with her unscrupulous gigolo lover and life in the big city. The film also does a sly take on that hoary leftover Victorian cliché, the distant wealthy uncle who conveniently dies: here the uncle rather inconveniently comes back to life (\"not so darn dead after all\" as a title card dryly observes).

Depp's character is more true to the book, but let's face it, Wilder's Wonka makes the audience fear and love him at the same time. With Depp, you have a non threatening wise cracking, high pitched Wonka. Adults will make the connection to Michael Jackson, but it is doubtful that the kiddies will. Highmore does an excellent job with Charlie, and isn't as annoying as the original Charlie. His family also has more interaction. As far as the kids: Augustus was improved, much funnier; Veruca,..well, honestly the original Veruca definitely seemed more like a spoiled little brat, so you were happier to see her go; Mike TV is annoying in both films, however, I kinda liked the original's Jay Leno-ish lisp. The implementation of video games for the new Mike will probably connect better with kids though; Violet was definitely improved, and her mom was just creepy, but thats good.The beloved familiar songs are gone, and while the lyrics of the new soundtrack might be clever and humorous, the accompanying music is too loud and cluttered to hear it. While I was watching, I noticed that most songs ended without a chuckle from the audience, and I attribute that to them being inaudible. The effects were well done, a nice surprise in this era of crap CGI laziness in Hollywood. The Oompas are all the same character, which honestly doesn't really bug me that much. The music is what let me down. I like the background on the Oompas, it added a little fresh air to the movie, and gave you something new, and not redone.You definitely get a little more knowledge of Wonka's background as well as Charlie's family, including a dad that was not present in the first flick. I thought the background story was good, however, it was not presented in a timely fashion. It's hard for this film to compete with the original, just on nostalgic value alone. The original is a bona fide classic, and even though technology has changed, it is not the most important factor. Especially in a movie that is supposed to tug at your heart strings, as well as dazzle your eyes.Children will love it, and maybe cherish it when they are older, as the older generations now cherish the '71 version. But us older folks might leave the theater disappointed, noticing Hollywood's greedy hands as they stick their hands in our pockets while trying to distract us with 'amazing' CGI. Don't get me wrong, like I said before, the CGI was good, and the sets were great, but there was something missing, something needed to draw you in and captivate your imagination. I went into this with a solid confidence that if anyone could or should redo the original, the Burton/Elfman/Depp crew were the ones to do it. I've been a huge fan of the trio since I can remember, and have had, and will continue to have faith in their creativity and vision. Corpse Bride looks awesome, and I'm sure Burton will redeem himself with that one.This is a delicate anomaly of a movie to review, so I'll end with this: Don't see it if you want to see a new, improved original. See it if you are taking your kids and family. The joy that they will get from it might stir up the joy you got from the original, just in case the new one doesn't tickle your fancy.</td><td>rw1134066</td><td>For a different generation</td><td>Zombafyed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(3, 8)</td><td>The Devil's Rejects (2005)</td><td>3</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>Having enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses more than any other horror movie I have ever seen I went to see Devil's Rejects with very high expectations from Zombie. I was very disappointed. The use of strong language, which was employed wonderfully in the first film, was over used and eventually completely superfluous to the film itself. And while the violence was as brutal as you would expect from Zombie it seems his imagination ran dry in this second film. You can only be shocked so many times by the sight of a fleshy human mask. Even the characters were not as involving or interesting as they had been in the first film. If it had not been for Sid Haig giving us the Captain Spaulding we came to love from the first movie, it would have been completely worthless. Portions of the film seem to drag on endlessly, especially the scene with the movie expert rattling on and on about the Marx Brothers. I left the theatre feeling almost cheated; the invincible and completely insane characters, which were charming in the first film, had become these motiveless violent foul-mouthed vigilantes that I was loath to watch for two hours. In summation, Rob Zombie took a wonderful cult horror movie and added to it an insidious sequel that is not worth the price of admission.

The female stars were OK. Stiller's embarrassment of his parent's quirks and desire to impress his future in-laws is really comical. Meanwhile, the overly conservative Jack Byrnes(DeNiro)scans the Fokkers for reasons to prove why they do not \"qualify\" to be married into his family. I've never been a real DeNiro fan, but loved him in this movie. This could be one of the best performances in Robert DeNiro's career.

And I have to say, in defense of 'Killer Shrews' that there is just a hint of something good in this amusing period piece.Let's get a few things out of the way, right up front: The special effects for the title monsters are completely laughable (hand puppets for the close up shots and dogs covered with bath mats for the master shots). And not only do two of the main players have nearly impenetrable accents, the whole film is miked so badly that you can barely catch two words out of every three. The film takes forever to get started, and the first 20 minutes of the film is so static and badly blocked that you want to leave the room yourself to break things up and add some variety. The photography is grainy, badly lit black-and-white, especially in the indoor scenes. Some of the acting is strictly from Amateur Hour (especially the blond beauty pageant winner who we are asked to believe is a research scientist), and the rest of the acting is at the mercy of the plot and the director. The denouement, where the surviving cast members tie together a bunch of barrels that just *happen* to be in their backyard, get under the barrels and essentially barge past the shrews to the beach front - is so silly and badly done that you can't help but chuckle (including some of the most badly staged 'fake walking' you will ever see in a movie). And yet, there is some fun to be had here. The screenplay works mightily to establish an airtight, claustrophobic, no-way-out scenario for the cast. Best's character is articulate and resourceful in a 50's monster movie kind of way. Ken Curtis pulls out all the stops to portray a completely unsympathetic alcoholic, coward, back-shooting Judas and full time punching bag for James Best. The character actor who plays the absent-minded assistant professor actually imbues the role with a certain pleasant humanity and decency in spite of the cardboard nature of the role. There IS a palpable tension, and even anxiety and dread, in some of the scenes that manages to last in spite of the tons of exposition that get piled into the first half of the movie. Three stars out of 10. I can't rate it any lower than that in spite of the relatively low quality because I actually ended up kind of liking it in spite of all its faults - unlike many denizens of the Bottom 100, it tries to be about something, and has a certain innocence and enthusiasm that leavens the silliness and cheapness of the proceedings.</td><td>rw1134071</td><td>Amusing period piece with glints of potential under all the rubbish</td><td>lemon_magic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 2)</td><td>Army of Darkness (1992)</td><td>9</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>If the title of this comment didn't make you want to see the movie, maybe these will: Zomibies, shotguns, chainsaws, exploding arrows, evil twins, and time travel.

My favourite parts are Chow's classic \"stair slide\" and the hospital gun fight where Tequila and Tony face off with Mad Dog. When Mad Dog rides into the warehouse and dismounts his bike (and kills) is also stylish and noteworthy. Out of the three John Woo movies I have (A Better Tomorrow-excellent; Once A Thief-meh and Hard Boiled), I'd have to put ABT slightly ahead of this one because of the storyline and Mark's restaurant assassination is my all time favourite gun scene.

This film doesn't change that. It does have passable performances from Gabriel Casseus and Raymond Cruz to off-set the outright horrible ones of Antwon Tanner and Kenya Moore. Better than average (at least for direct to video) cinematography is overshadowed by the stale production design, dismal writing, dead action sequences, and repetitive stock hip-hop music. Hip-hop could hack it in a western, just hear T-Bone Burnett's work with the Nappy Roots in \"The Ladykillers\" and imagine the possibilities. But here, it's a complete distraction.

The audience enjoyed the movie as you could tell from their laughter at Jamie's quips.While the plot is a bit predictable, it truly is an enjoyable ride.

Burroughs fanatic).Likewise with Crash, a movie that will have you saying 'what the hell was that all about?' for the rest of the day after watching it, unless you already dig the psychotic, proto-rivet-head literary musings of J.G.

Some with big flourishes with the entire village dancing. Other times intimate songs and dances that capture the passion of two people in love. The traditional Indian dances are exhilarating and the singing will leave you breathless. Sometimes the songs do repeat themselves so just fast forward them a little. But all in all the musical numbers are captivating and exhilarating. The plot dealing with British imperialism will teach you a history lesson. Political intrigue and an interracial love are the glue that hold it together. You will see the clash between Indian culture and British rule. This film will give you a look into an exotic land that few of us will ever see. And for this alone you should see this film.Do not overlook seeing this movie.

The material appears to be recorded on two days at the same stage and comes across as a very coherent concert experience.The technical aspect is excellent and the playing is very controlled and manages to bring the wide array of music contained on the numerous records into one package very well, fusing old and new material together.Naturally DeGarmo was a huge part of Queensrÿche and will feel missing here. On the other hand, this recording really shows just how much Michael Wilton (and the rest) can do. The singing is commendable and quite faithful to the originals, containing no ugly visioning or surprises that so typically tend to end up on live records.It is clearly a live show but it manages to have sound and performance \"quality\" rivaling studio recordings.

Seeing a dirty, decrepit, drunken man like bukowski in the lead role might have made this movie mildly interesting, but instead we have this overacting pretty boy horribly miscast. Additionally, the rest of the casting was equally atrocious-more watered down acting from the likes of Marissa Tomai, etc. If you want to see the real Bukowski on screen check out Barfly, which is not perfect, but much better, or better yet try to track down the old documentary video called ¨Bukowski drinks, smokes, and talks,¨ which has candid footage of bukowski boozing, chain smoking, driving around the sleaziest parts of LA and yelling at his girl friend.

Instead of giving the child interviewees a voice and a chance to talk about their lives before and during their military boarding school, this director serves us a series of narrated pathos-embedded statements depicting their awful backgrounds. As the homeless boys in the film are clearly working on restoring their crushed egos by trying to function progressively as group members in an institution accepted and respected by the society they live in, this immature, socio-pornographic primadonna comes with her pathological need to throw Gothic sensations out of her poetic dirt-bag. How little can a person understand the ashamed mind of the homeless and rejected and still be allowed to direct documentaries about this subject?

The only redeeming part of it was the last few minutes, man, Barbara Hershey still looks hot at 51! A movie has to pass two tests to get a good rating with me: (1.) A good, interesting plot, no fast forwarding to get past the boring parts. Has to keep my interest all the way through. (2.) A good ending, easy to understand, so I'm glad I watched it. Drowning on Dry Land failed both tests.Probably at least 20 percent of the movie was scenes that could easily be fast-forwarded through without missing a thing. Long scenes of driving along the highway, or someone simply walking along a road. The scene with the flat tire could be completely excised, no one would miss it.The ending? How did it end? I couldn't figure it out. I watched the last couple of minutes three times, still can't figure it out.

With such great actors like Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins, and Jet li's acting has much improved as well. This movie combines some of my favorite genres from Kung-fu to drama, to action and perhaps even gore, this movie is rather violent. I think it was done so, as to convey the kind of violence that Danny inherited due to his evil master's example/ways. I think the story is perfectly believable, and it just keeps getting better, there isn't a dull moment from the jaw dropping fight scenes, some of jet li's best I think since Fist of Legend, and Once upon a time in china.

I rented the DVD and the sound track is terrible for a film from this period. It's hard to make out some of the dialogue, especially when a character turns away from the camera. I hate having to strain to hear dialogue, especially dialogue by Chekhov! It seems to be a recording problem. The film was shot on what seem to be massive stage sets. This family's provincial home looks roughly the size of the Winter Palace. I'm guessing the cavernous sets swallowed up and muffled the dialogue, resulting in the poor sound quality.Aside from the deficiencies of the sound (and there's no excuse for such a problem in a production from 1970 -- fire that sound engineer!) it's a great production of a gently funny and bittersweet classic play.</td><td>rw1134116</td><td>Superb cast, production; lousy sound</td><td>fwmurnau</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(6, 12)</td><td>Almost Dead (1994)</td><td>1</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>Completely ridiculous!!!

Here's what I got from the movie. (1) - Shaukat plays a control freak to the hilt, who feels like his ability to artistically create something carries over to reality. He fools himself into truly believing in the power of his work, that he's so talented he somehow has the ability to not only control his wife's actions, but also her innermost thoughts and feelings. When Shaukat realizes that he can't control Antara (I can't believe I still remember these names, by the way - I haven't seen the film since opening night back in Feb) he goes insane and loses his own grip on reality. (2) - I don't know why anyone would be interested in this cautionary tale for artists- I think the point of the movie for artists is to realize that you can't take your work so seriously as to have it control you to such an extent as Shaukat did. Realistic, natural art can't be manufactured, it flows from within. He can't forcefully create a love affair between Antara and Yash because this isn't in his control. He's so wrapped up in making a \"realistic\" story after such extreme critical rejection that he tries to force a situation that naturally can't occur. When he realizes that he's ultimately powerless, he loses his mind. Lets look at Shaukat's motivations besides his need for critical success and the desire for the power to make situations happen - his desire to \"play god\" so to speak. Abstract notions aside, I think Shaukat was also bored with his marriage and his life. He marries his student who appears to be a mysterious and beautiful young woman. He sees her as this enigma, a woman who he thinks will always be able to keep him on his toes, guessing. Antara doesn't turn out this way. She turns out to be a simple girl who eventually becomes a professor and falls into a life of predictability in marriage and work. Shaukat's notion of women is anything but simple - his character Tamanna is supposedly based on how he views his wife- mysterious, sexy, beautiful, and ultimately conniving and manipulative. But this is NOT the woman simple Antara really is. He wants to make her into something she's not because he's bored with the real Antara, so he sets out to spice up his marriage through his work by throwing this character based on what he WANTS his wife to be into an affair with Yash. Antara really doesn't enter into an affair with Yash, only managing to stay friends with him and turning him away at the end. So Shaukat fails to recreate his wife's personality and make his wife and marriage more interesting - another ironic reality he can't seem to face. She tells Shaukat in the beginning, while he's having writers block, \"Don't look for your story in me, I'm just a simple woman with simple dreams.\" He doesn't want the simple woman, he wants the temptress he imagines in his writings. Unfortunately for Antara, he prefers Tamanna, evidenced by the her sexy dance he imagines at the restaurant while they're dancing to \"Sholon Si.\" He sees the temptress Tamanna dancing seductively to the music surrounded by men rather than his boring, docile wife Antara, who only manages to submissively slow-dance with him. Ultimately, Shaukat can't face the fact that he's a loser, professionally as a writer and personally as a bored husband. He wants a certain lifestyle of the flashy, sensual, and mysterious wife and a hotshot career as a writer. He ends up a reclusive failed writer living in seclusion and falling into a life of marital boredom. Antara and Shaukat's dance at the end in the asylum is his submission to these facts and willingness to try to accept the ordinary life he has rather than the exciting life he covets.This is a beautiful story of a man who wants too much from life and ends up not getting any of it. It's rather cruel in a way, this writer is given an initial taste of success and a life of fame, only to have it taken away.The performances, barring Zayed Khan who was awkwardly terrible were excellent. Aishwarya plays two different characters - Antara, the vulnerable woman and Tamanna, the bewitching, mysterious, and conniving fantasy Shaukat wants Antara to be. She does both characters remarkably well and with a lot of subtle facial nuances. Her facial expressiveness brings a level of depth to both characters. Sanjay Dutt is brilliant as the alpha-male writer who refuses to accept mediocrity in life and in work. His presence is commanding. No one could have played Shaukat the way he did. Maybe if Bachchan was younger, he'd have the style and panache to do it, but no one else in my opinion. Dutt has that movie-star arrogance and charisma to make the role believable. And he has some smoldering chemistry with Aishwarya Rai. I've never seen Aish look so alluring with another male costar - she's like a block of ice with everyone else. But it looks like she's got a thing for Sanjay with the way they interact on screen. What a great looking couple. The film is beautifully shot, like a wonderfully dark painting. Everything looks classy and gorgeous, especially the songs. The movie may have been confusing but if you take the time to really explore these characters and the untold motivations behind these characters and their actions. It's all there, you just have to think about it and look hard enough. Art is subjective, even if you don't agree with my interpretation, you'll still take something of your own away from the movie.

It is a human theme and it is therefore easy to connect to when it is shown screen. For this reason, a number of viewers will perhaps take well to this film. However, those same people would take well to an average run-of-the-mill telepic that deals with the same issues, as this film is no better than such productions. Although the ideas and issues are easy to relate to, the same stuff has been explored in many other films, many times before, and the fashion that they are presented in here is very hackneyed. The characters are never better than ordinary, and they are even a tad annoying to have on screen. There is also a severe under-development of Joan Allen's character, as we see her angry, but we do not see her before she changes, and therefore there is no contrast: no visible change. Allen has received a lot of praise for being so angry and stressed, but she is never not - so she is just playing one emotional type - and I cannot call that a good performance myself. The rest of the cast deliver reasonably well, but there are no great performances.

The camera work is at times stunning, putting us not just right on stage at the Grey Fox Festival, but intimately close to instruments played expertly and with great affection. The offerings by Dobro virtuoso Jerry Douglas are by themselves worth the price of the DVD.The directors have inexplicably included a grating scene of a New Age wedding which not only adds absolutely nothing to the film, but detracts from it. One can only speculate as to why they deemed this worthy of our attention, but omitted any portrayal of the hymns and Sunday morning Gospel sings which are integral to the genre, and which grace almost every bluegrass festival I've ever heard of.The unfortunate wedding scene notwithstanding, \"Bluegrass Journey\" is a worthwhile tribute to a truly American art form.</td><td>rw1134125</td><td>Not quite perfect</td><td>hrhqueene</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(3, 3)</td><td>Steve Vai: Live at the Astoria London (2003 Video)</td><td>7</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>What can I say? Steve Vai is a god. I bought this DVD after seeing Steve live in April in Toronto. Despite being mostly an instrumentalist, Steve Vai has a compelling stage presence, and he is in excellent form on this DVD. Not only is he the best, the rest of his band are very skilled musicians and some of the best. Billy Sheehan is simply put, an incredible bassist. Tony Macalpine is a shredder capable of playing some of Steve's hardest lines, but that's not just it, his keyboard skill may even surpass his guitar playing. Dave Weiner is another good guitar player who plays most of the rhythm. And finally, Virgil Donati provides a strong back bone to the whole thing, being a very intense drummer (he also has a drum solo, which starts a little slow, but when it builds up it is amazing). The set is great and contains most of his best songs. The highlights (in my opinion) are: Erotic Nightmares (one of my personal faves), Blue Powder, Little Wing, The Crying Machine, The Animal, Jibboom and The Attitude Song. A Vai tradition, Steve brings up Eric Sardinas (his opening man, also a very good guitar player) for the Attitude Song and extended soloing ensues from all players (at this moment, 4 guitarists and a bassist!). It is also noteworthy that Steve reproduces all effects heard in songs (remember the weird interlude in Blue Powder?). Along with his own songs, two Sheehan songs, two Hendrix covers, a classical piece and Dave Weiner's solo are included. Also, listen to the beginning of Fire where Steve talks about Britney Spears. This is also a trend with him, we got to hear about Britney at the Toronto concert, Heh. If you have any interest in guitar, BUY THIS.

Marina Levtoza (who later went on to star in what was a bigger box office success, yet inferior critical success, 'President i yego zhenshchina' aka 'The President and his Women') delivers a strikingly convincing performance as the mentally unhinged love interest Belogurochka. It is delightful to see a horror film of this calibre (trash horror) trying its hand at some old fashioned Biblical symbolism, as Marina is enticed by the dark side, or Satan's path, as represented by the witches. This is pure Genesis parody, and the tremendous clout of the chromatic imagery is rival, if not commensurate, to that of Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968).

A paradise for the lucky few lottery winners?While one may think this is a rip off on some sub part 70's B flick, I get the feeling this is a segway from Logan's Run, THX 1138 and others. The cast is good, the script is good ... along with the story (important) though some action scenes will stretch (and maybe break?) your belief, these transgressions are minor. All action movies have 'reality' issues.I suppose it is fashionable to bash Micheal Bay. I never really paid attention - but I guess, because of the Pearl Harbor disaster (the film with Ben Afleck, not the actual events from December 7th), people have a deep seated hatred for the director. This hatred is seemingly enhanced by the number of explosions that Bay uses in some of his movies.I think The Island (TI) got a bad rap for product placement. I think this is mostly undeserved. I did think the XBox (live people fighting) was badly placed... it just seemed silly, but other 'placements' seemed very natural - or even funny in a good way. And this leads to the car chase (or one of them). It was much better than the Matrix 2 car chase where all cars seemed to be of a new GM origin and the only cool car was the Camaro (also of GM origin, but at least it had SOME originality). Of course the ads in the movie theater can get annoying ... but that's nothing to do with the movie.I think Bay & Co did a very good job of setting the scene and showing us the human qualities of Jordan and Lincoln. In many ways they seemed more human than the others. Many big questions are raised by this movie and I think many statements are made about the human condition and what people will do to stay alive. How did Lincoln Six Echo develop memories from another person? What kind of influence did the tech/ McCord (played by Steve Buscemi) have on Lincoln. Merrick (Sean Bean) brings up this point, but I think his lack of a real answer makes a bigger statement than anything else.What is real and what is human? What is the nobility of the human spirit ... While these questions are different for everyone I think they are important and should have answers. This movie gives many answers and leaves the right questions.The dialog in TI is good, the actors are good, Scarlet is hot and did well with her role ... I've seen this once and I give it a 9 out of 10.I would go into this movie with as little knowledge about TI, as possible. I would ignore jaded reviewers (professionals who get PAID to review!) who get fussy at the oddest things. I would also ignore the 15 year old retards (is that redundant?) who fail understand that all these ideas are in the public domain and DIRECTORS do not plagiarize (unless they are writers!).

The best scene was when Franciscus' character tells the townspeople that they have to obey the Nazis' orders \"...for your own good.\" Obviously, that's the fascist philosophy: impose rules on everyone, and tell them that it's for their own good.

The film is correctly based on historic events . The stalwart but tragic defense has become one of American history's most often repeated legends,although historical research has revealed a few facts that go unmentioned.For instance,Sam Houston,commander in chief of the Texas forces,never felt that the crumbling mission could stand up to a siege,and ordered frontiersman Jim Bowie to destroy.He didn't ,however,and rescinded the order and sent attorney turned colonel William B.Travis to defend it.The force that remained in the mission the date the siege began,is estimated at between 182 .Of these less than 20 were actually Texans,the rest including Bowie and another frontier legend,Davy Crookett were volunteers.Early all of them believed that reinforcements were only a short time away.Santa Anna Launched a pre-dawn attack.To the strains of ¨deguello¨a battle march indicating that no quarter would be given,or no prisoners taken,some 1800 Mexicans troops stormed the fort.They were thrown back by the cannon and rifles of the defenders,they rushed again,and were repulsed a second time.Eventually Santa Anna sent another wave of troops who broke the outer defenses and forced the Texans to retreat,fighting hand to hand.When the fighting was over,there were no survivors among the defenders.The myth that the garrison fought to the last man ,however isn't quite accurate,since the evidence indicates that Davy Crockett and several others were captured and possibly tortured,then executed.That they died bravely has never been disputed.William Travis who at least according to legend,invited all who would stay and die with him to cross the line in the dirt,fell near a cannon at the north wall.And Jim Bowie,already deathly ill from a sickness that had recently claimed wife and children,fought from his sickbed near the main gate.Like many others among the defenders Bowie was armed with the formidable hunting knife named for him.The legendary defense served as a rallying point for the beleaguered Texas.Although Santa Anna ,who lost at least 600 of some 3000 troops against a force of less than 200,referred as a small affair,the valor of the defenders gave the surviving Texan troops something to remember and thus they did,six weeks later at San Jacinto,but a new battle cry had been added to the annals of American history:¨Remember the Alamo¨</td><td>rw1134153</td><td>Interesting rendition of the mythic Alamo mission with impressive battles</td><td>ma-cortes</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>House of Wax (2005)</td><td>4</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>the acting in this movie has the quality of a year 8 drama class, the surprises of a power rangers show ( every moment is predictable)and the depth of a puddle.the character are unlikeable idiots , there is a obvious attraction between (the actors not the characters) the supposed twins which ruins the idea of them being brother and sister completely.

Just as I was about to turn it off, because it was going nowhere, the movie devolved into some story involving some predictable thugs who had some part in the film.Basically it turns out that Cruise really is some badass who forms some kind of \"bond\" with Foxx.

That I still remember several scenes after one viewing thirty years ago, says much more about the impact of the film than it does about my memory.The film is set in the Twin Cities in one of the working class neighborhoods such as existed before the collapse of America's manufacturing culture. Two young friends work in a St. Paul car dealership as mechanics. One is an unmarried wisecracker, the other is more sober and married. The latter's wife is late in her pregnancy and it is the middle of the summer. The summer heat, the boredom of the job and home life, the sense of pinched finances create an atmosphere of a dead end to life in one's late twenties. (One simple shot of the three lead characters sitting on cheap lawn chairs accomplishes so much in advancing this theme.) Through the provocation of the wiseacre friend, the more stable one attempts to rebel against his situation. The outcome of this revolt provides the final theme.The film was shot in the cinema verite, black and white hand-held camera style.

This TV show brings to light the reality of today's disposable relationship and the trials and tribulations that go with pursuing the ultimate in companionship. The series is more or less a series of short stories of a half hour in length each. Each episode shows a very different situation that, while seeming to be the stuff of pure fantasy, is a graphic portrayal of reality in today's sexually curious society. I have seen the first two episodes of this series titled 'Trust Up' and 'Cocktales'. The first episode shows the struggle a young woman deals with when she discovers the man she has met at a local nightclub and spent the night with is actually the same man that her male gay best friend met and has been sleeping with from a gay chat line. This realisation tests her ability to come to terms with the hurt and the internal struggle of her conscience trying to decide whether to tell her friend or not. Eventually she does, however, far from seeming overly upset, her friend keeps coming with reasons and excuses why he should still see this man even though it clearly shows that he is bisexual and not gay and in being so, cannot rule out future experimentation. She tries in vein to convince him that this guy, Callum, is only going to hurt him again and when all else fails goes online, posing as a gay chatter and send a message to her best friend to try and convince him to meet up for sex. He declines saying he has met someone and when he tells her (thinking it is a man) to stick with it as he will find someone soon, she decides to say she has and gives him Callum's handle to indicate that he is screwing around still. This seems to be the final straw for him and he leaves Callum. The episode however finishes with her meeting with Callum for a lunch date and even though he swears to her that he will never do it again, him glancing at their male waiter's backside as he walks away still leaves the door open for his continuing experimentation. The second episode was one that I thought was brilliant. The episode begins in a cocktail bar where people are drinking lavishly and enjoying themselves. Appearing at first that the subtexts of three woman are going to be the basis of the episode, all with very different personality types, and all of whom have agreed to meet this 'Larry', who they have found over a dating website, in this bar, it soon centres on just one of them, a nervous yet beautiful girl sitting at the bar. The twist is that you soon realise that their respective dates is the same man, the barman. As they don't know the one their looking for is the barman, he plays all three woman during the evening until it is certain to him that the one he has been plying with alcohol at the bar all night, played by the absolutely gorgeous Natalie Saleeba, is going to be his best chance of a 'positive' outcome at the end of the evening. Thinking she has been stood up by her date, Larry, she agrees to have a drink with the barman at closing time. After spending an enthralling night of passion in bed with her, she wakes up at his apartment in the morning. After getting up, she sees something that indicates to her that his man may the one she was supposed to meet and that he has been playing her. She discovers this by seeing in the apartment block across the street, a dominatrix walking around scantily clad in her apartment and realises quickly that she is the very same dominatrix that her online beau, 'Larry' has been describing to her in their online fantasy sessions. Viewers, however, cannot be certain that she has made this connection. The rest of the episode plays out with the two of them forming a relationship but with her very cunningly openly continuing her online relationship with 'Larry' which gets up the nose of the barman, even though he is the one she is actually communicating with online. She discusses things online with Larry that the barman does with her in bed, yet the barman can't admit this annoys him as he believes she doesn't know that he is Larry. It ends with her finally agreeing after an argument to end the online relationship and to do some of the sexual things with him that she does online with Larry. Sufficed to say this involves her wearing a dominatrix outfit and with him tied to the bed. The next morning, the barman's flatmate finds him still tied to the bed trying to untie himself with a message written in red lipstick on his chest saying, 'You're half the man Larry will ever be'. A perfect end to this episode that demonstrates that while sexual experimentation seems to be a part of everyday life and is not necessarily wrong, it does not mean that feelings and emotions aren't involved. Overall, a great series and hope there are many more episodes to come.</td><td>rw1134160</td><td>A real eye-opener - Love Bytes</td><td>exxy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(8, 10)</td><td>Pizza My Heart (2005 TV Movie)</td><td>8</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>This movie was not the worst movie of all time.

As a cultural study, it has some things to say, with an insight into the culture of the indigenous Indian population, but it conveys little in the way of messages, as the screenplay is awfully convoluted, not helped by switching between different narrators and time periods. Some of the supporting characters are not defined well either, and there are a few lethargic gaps between events in the tale.

However, in this day of age of corny teen movies where there's nudity a plenty, kegs in every other scene and stereotypical ethnic characters, Better Luck Tomorrow is a refreshing reminder that there are other stories of high school that are much darker than the usual. This movie is one of those stories, and even though it starts out a bit slow, and seems to follow in the beginning all of the stereotypes that we are accustomed to seeing in normal run of the mill teen flicks. This film will surprise plenty of audiences and show a much darker brand of people that we aren't accustomed to seeing in this Post-Columbine Era.The story is a bit simple at first, and seems to be the usual garbage that we see in teen movies everywhere: Shy guy is in love with cute cheerleader girl, but is unable to hook up with her. The first thirty minutes seem to be a bit hard to watch, mainly because it seems like this film will be no different than American Pie, but only with Asian-Americans.However, the movie takes a certain turn when the main character begins to meet more Asians like him, and pretty soon, like a house of cards,everything begins to fall apart and he is brought up in a whirlwind of deceit, greed and even murder. Thus, with elements like these, this film keeps the viewer glued to his or her seat awaiting every twisting turn that is going to happen next. Even though the ending is a bit anti-climatic, making the audience wanting to know what would happen next, it is still a story that is truly original and a breath of fresh air from the usual happy go lucky high school stuff.With the cast being primarily Asian, it was interesting to see how the characters would be depicted. With most teen movies, Asians are stereotyped extremely bad, usually playing roles where the English is butchered and they are computer and library nerds that do nothing but study and watch Japanese Animation. However, the characters are a bit two-sided, which is a great credit to the writers of this film. For at first, the movie seems to follow that stereotype, depicting the Asian kids as nerds who competed in Academic Decathalons and wrote liberalized articles for the school newspaper. But, like the plot of the movie, the characters take turns in terms of personality, and throughout the movie the viewer begins to see the savage personalities and the characters that are really behind the masks of those stereotypes. While the screenwriters deserve credit for these characters, the actors are the real winners, for this unknown cast does a great job depicting these two-faced Asian kids that are half-Honor Roll caliber and half-gangsters. The only familiar face in the movie is Harold from Harold and Kumar, but his role is relatively small compared to the other main actors. While it is hard to remember there names off the top of my head, there performances were extraordinary, filled with subtleness, emotion and anger that is characteristic of good actors. This movie is quite a good stepping stone for these young Asian-Amercian actors, and it will be interesting to see what other movies they will grace in next.It won't be surprising to see many Christian parents hating this movie. The issue of teen violence and drug usage is a very sensitive issue in this day of age, especially after Columbine. However, this is a wonderful movie that is savage and enlightening, for it puts a whole new view on Asian American students in high school, and helps destroy the stereotypes that have accompanied them for years. In its essence, this movie is not about high school kids, but about racism to a certain degree. It shows that stereotypes and premature predilections can not always be accurate, and thus should be avoided in our society today. However, that is a complex message and it requires a true intellectual to pick up on the director's message of racism and stereotypes, but if the audience can't pick up that message, there is still one hell of a movie in Better Luck Tomorrow. For it is a teen movie, but a teen movie that has the grittiness of a pulp indie such as Reservoir Dogs, thus making it enjoyable fare for those who have gotten sick of the usual \"boy meets girl\" comedies and dramas.</td><td>rw1134170</td><td>A Breath of Fresh Air from the Usual \"Teen Movie\" Norm</td><td>objesguy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 11)</td><td>Godzilla vs. Hedorah (1971)</td><td>1</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>This movie was designated the worst Godzilla film in the 50 Worst Movies book and I can easily see why. Now I must admit up front that I think MOST Godzilla films (apart from the original) are pretty silly. Most of them I saw as a child too young to know better. However, I watched this movie only a day ago because I am crazy enough to WANT to see all 50 of these \"worst movies\".I really don't want to attack the movie for the costumes--after all, these are guys running around in rubber suits and they are rather expected to be cheesy. But the plot--yuck!! It's supposed to be sort of a pro-environment epic teaching us about the evils of pollution (since the monster grew and thrived on all our garbage and clouds of pollution) but I really doubt if very many people will take that message to heart--they'll just laugh! So what in the plot did I think was the funniest (cheesiest)? Well, I loved how the respected scientist seemed to consult with the annoying little kid (he looked about 7) all the time and the kid seemed to know more about the monster than everyone else! This was funniest when the scientist started talking to him about nuclear radiation and then space travel! Second, when the monster began belching out toxic gasses that choked to death or dissolved the unfortunate people nearby, what do all the teenagers do? Yes, have a giant dance party on Mt. Fuiji!!! Cool, Daddy-O!!! So anyways, if you want to see the worst Godzilla flick (and that's saying a lot), give this one a try.

I had the chance to see it on the big screen at a revival screening some months ago (mostly among Joan Crawford fans) on a double bill with Sam Fuller's Forty Guns. Crawford, McCambridge, and definitely Sterling Hayden (one of my all-time favorite 'guy' actors) brought a lot to the entertainment factor of the film. The story goes like this (and if you've seen Sergio Leone's Once Upom a Time in the West, you'll notice obvious similarities, as his was a slight homage of this film)- Crawford owns a bar/parlor on the edge of town. The townspeople want her out to make way for a railroad, most vocally of this is McCambridge (in maybe the best performance of the film, really the most theatrical). The title character is played with usual panache by Hayden, who at first is a little enigmatic, then reveals himself to have a past with Crawford. The story then unravels from there, in a way that actually went against my expectations, much to my delight. This is the kind of genre picture that knows what it is, but with a director clever enough to take chances. For example, there is the contrast of color between Crawford and the angry townspeople near the beginning of the film. She's playing the piano on one side of the room in a white dress, while the others, the supposedly 'good' people of the town, are all in black. Is Ray messing with the convention of good guys white, bad guys black, or do we have to keep attentive all the way through to know how it plays out? I think you'd have to - this is one of those westerns that has enough excitement, humor (mostly dark or unintentional), and a climax that goes with some of the best of them. At the least it should hold up for those expecting something very dated- it's not quite as towering as the Leone films, but on its own terms Ray has a contender against all those old-school Ford/Wayne westerns.</td><td>rw1134172</td><td>one of my favorite westerns</td><td>Quinoa1984</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 6)</td><td>Mr. Nanny (1993)</td><td>3</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>I saw this movie years back when it first came out. I was a kid and a wrestling fan at the time, and Hulk Hogan in a movie? You're darned right I'm going! My brother, dad and I went the very first week it opened! Good thing we did, because it didn't last to week two.The movie is basically Hogan as an out of work wrestler. His manager/agent Burt (Sherman Helmsley) can't get him any in ring work because him and Hogan told a promoter they weren't throwing matches. You may say, isn't wrestling scripted like a play? Yeah, but this is 1993. That was still a secret. So anyway, Burt can't put him in the ring so he gets him a job as a body guard for a scientist who just created the chip to some missile or something. Hogan thinks he's golden until he learns that he's not guarding the scientist: he's guarding his kids. The kids are little monsters who have terrorized every nanny they've ever had. Plus one added twist we didn't see coming: HOGAN HATES KIDS!!! So who will have the last laugh, Hogan or the kids? The answer: not the audience.The kids play cruel jokes on Hogan in order to get him to leave. These include short-sheeting his bed, making his exercise bike go really fast and causing him to fall into a pool of red seaweed. I know. The horror. Hogan sticks in there, though, and gets the kids to like him once he spends time with the daughter Kate and teaches the son Alex how to stick up for himself. Of course the son uses his brains, because violence is never the answer. Especially when an ex pro wrestler is on the job.The kids finally fall in love with the Hulkster for good when he punishes them. If God were kind it would be by him giving Alex a big boot and dropping the legdrop on Kate. Sadly, he doesn't even give the \"YOU!!!\" finger. After making them sit on a couch for about an hour, the kids finally respect him and listen. Because their dad never did it and that's why he failed, get it? The movie finally ends when the villain who is trying to steal the chip turns out to be the same wrestling promoter Hogan and Burt told to take a hike years back. That's right: a wrestling promoter turned world-domination villain. Not even Vince Russo could write that piece of gold! The villain, who has a metal skull cap for reasons I don't have the energy to type, is finally vanquished and Hogan isn't needed anymore. But he doesn't leave empty handed. He learns an important lesson about a children's love. Plus he ties Kate's dolly to his motorcycle. And good times are had by all. Except those who have sat through this piece of crapola.I loved this movie when I was a kid. I watched it over and over (haven't watched it since and I still know the whole story).

Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to hold an outrageous, boiling anger throughout the entire film, which is due to her overwhelming passion to become prom queen. However, it becomes completely unknown to the audience why Cherry wants to become prom queen in the first place. Before the nominations are even read off, she storms around the school with a constant disinterest upon being there, and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with. Why does she care so much to be their prom queen? Brooke Balderson apparently presents an \"acclaimed\" performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face, stomping around, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you handed any young actor/actress a script that only requires him/her to act insanely angry, you're not asking for much. You're also not allowing the character to develop very well.Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her character whatsoever. When being harassed by her principal, she knocks him down (after several seconds) with no feelings of disgust or shock or anything equally traumatizing. Her lines are read like she is reading trivia off the back of a cereal box.Throughout the rest of the film, the students in charge of his kidnapping sound more like they are planning a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their principal, sitting tied up in their basement.Meanwhile, Cherry is off killing several female prom queen candidates, and no one even notices or cares. (Yeah, I get it, I get it, the whole town is worried about prom. Very realistic. At least you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops, but that might be asking too much.) For example, right after Cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of students, Beth is found being interviewed by the local media. The reporter mentions \"the shooter\" in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students, but then one second later asks, \"What do you think about guns in the hands of minors?\" or something to that effect. Where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over, with the media showing up again, Beth simply adds that \"she understands (Cherry's) need to be heard\" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unaltered mood. No one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder.Not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town, Julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at her house (Maybe I'm a little left out of the scene, but last time I knew, high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their \"I'm so indie and mod\" attitudes), Beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun.

I would point to Alexander Knox's performance in a supporting role, for one. Sessue Hayakawa, as the old fascist surviver, is also good.On the other hand, Florence Marly is pretty weak as the love interest and the plot is somewhat routine. The main plot problem is the Bogart/Marly relationship. There is just too much resemblance to the relationship between Rick and Ilsa in \"Casablanca.\" When you add in Marly's unconvincing performance, the chances of a having a first-rate film are slim. I must also add, reluctantly, that Bogie seems to be walking through this role, much as he did in another Santana film, \"Sirocco\" (1951).That brings me to my final point. Bogart had started Santana Productions in about 1948. \"Knock On Any Door\" was the company's first effort, and it was somewhat popular at the time. \"Tokyo Joe\" was the second Santana production. As a small start-up independent production company, Santana did not have a stable of outstanding actors to call upon. Perhaps that is why they had to make due with a Florence Marly instead of a top female lead to go opposite Bogart.It's also true that \"Chain Lightning,\" 1950, Bogie's next to last Warner Bros. release, wasn't so hot. Maybe the era of the tough but decent Bogart character had simply run its course.I might add here that the third Santana production was \"In a Lonely Place,\" 1950, one of Humphrey Bogart's best, though perhaps most under-appreciated, films.Give \"Tokyo Joe\" a try. It's no world beater, but I have watched it several times, and still find it entertaining.</td><td>rw1134176</td><td>Bogart action less than outstanding but worth a look.</td><td>bill-790</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 8)</td><td>Would I Lie to You?

The film manages to be both cynical and hopeful in its outlook on love, and straddles a fine line of highbrow and lowbrow humor pretty successfully. Susan Ward, the bad girl with a heart of stone from \"The In Crowd\" makes a 180 degree turn here from her previous tough chick roles, and she is just great as a slightly neurotic, insecure but lovable beauty. I never would have expected this type of character from her, but she's fantastic. Brad Rowe is a charming dweeb, and his character's insecurity works. Samaire Armstrong finally gets a leading role, and it's her best performance ever! She's probably got the most complex role in the film (I won't spoil the surprise), and plays the varying levels of her character to perfection. Jonathan Penner (loved him in \"The Last Supper\" with Cameron Diaz) comes on with a vengeance as a classic dirt bag.

This confusion and terror is probably one of the best aspects of the movie as it offers rare insight.

This analytic school of thinking was fathered by Freud and was very popular in the 1940s, though nowadays, most experts would agree that there is a very strong biological component to schizophrenia and few cases are the direct result of poor parenting.

However, I just found myself pretty bored by the picture and felt that watching practically EVERYONE (from the rich jet-setters to the servants) bouncing from partner to partner was not my cup of tea. It actually was rather funny that although practically everyone was cheating on their spouses in the film, they never really seemed to get around to having sex. Mostly, they just seemed to go through the motions of wooing and sneaking about instead of any real infidelity.Although a few Hollywood films have similar story elements, this movie stands in sharp contrast to the average American film. The French in the 1930s would probably have seen most Americans in films of the day as uptight and too conventional, while Americans would have been amazed at how fixated the French were on infidelity.

You see, every time I fired it up I thought, \"The rest of it can't possibly be as awful as the part I just watched. They can't possibly insult the viewer's intelligence any more than they have.\" The filmmakers proved me wrong each time.The script was clunky, the photography is badly framed and poorly shot, and much of the film just doesn't make any sense. Also, there isn't a single sequence the conclusion of which you can't see coming from a mile away- come on, of COURSE Johhny's \"side\" was going to win the impromptu football game when he has one hand shackled behind his back- and his girl is the prize! And Johnny Walker strutting down the Main street of his staid, middle-American town dressed like he's on his way to a Gay bar on Cowboy Night?! How ELSE would his straight-laced family react than with shock, indignation and disgust? As to the actors, Uma is lovely, Downey is Downey (and I admit is pretty good in his standard hopped-up sidekick role, especially in the motel scenes,) but Hall seems completely uninterested in what he's doing. He really acts as if he didn't really want to do this film, in spite of the fact that he DID want a vehicle that would break his Brat Pack Geek-in-Chief image. I felt sorry for him. He was really cute, but that was it. His character, Johnny Walker, speaks to a crowd of having embarrassed himself towards the end of the picture. To me, it seemed that Hall delivered those lines with utter conviction, and I'm not surprised. If this were on my resume, I'd deny it. Hall has, of course, gone on to a viable and even admirable career. I guess it's really true that you can't keep a good man down, even if he makes such a potentially suicidal career choice as this film. It's a testament to the man's drive and determination to succeed that he left trash like this far behind him and kept working.Another gripe I have: screenwriters Zacharias and Buhai wrote the original \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" so they ought to have known what would work in a Youth comedy. Apparently they forgot.The two worst aspects of this film, however, were these: first, it was unbelievably boring (and a bad movie that is boring is the worst bad movie of all); secondly, the lampooning of corruption in collegiate football is a viable topic and it could have worked if the script had been decent, the story been told in a logically plotted arc, Bud Smith hadn't directed and Hall had acted like he cared (and not mumbled his lines as if he were auditioning for the first time at a Junior High School's offering of Romeo and Juliet.)

For the most part the movie was done really well. Scenes to remember include: Harold, the Janitor, and his criticism of modern amenities and philosophy; Every scene with the Sheriff or his bumbling deputy; and the chicken store/gas station.At the chicken farm, Gary Busey stars as the butcher in one of his best rolls ever. He is witty, nutty, covered in blood, and best of all, in a light blue three piece suit and tie. Bam, phenomenal. Honestly, he was the entire reason I rented the film. When it comes down to choosing from Hasting's array of B Horror movies, touting Gary Busey is important. Especially when he is THE FIRST CREDITED ON THE BACK. In the synopsis on the case, it even makes mention of his character. -- hardcore -- or so I thought...Attention, spoiler to follow: Gary Busey is in this movie for approximately two minutes. He makes those two minutes worth it, but I spent the ENTIRE DURATION OF THE FILM WAITING FOR HIM TO SHOW UP AGAIN... and he never does.

So, this is indeed an historic record that any Beatles fan, or 60's music fan should own.</td><td>rw1134200</td><td>Historic</td><td>dougmarshall_94142</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>Repetition (I) (2005)</td><td>9</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>I just saw this film when the producer spoke to my Video Production class at Southern Oregon University.

Eric Dansen, the producer, stated that they rehearsed for three weeks prior to the 12 day shooting schedule, which allowed the actors to know each other and truly let their emotions flow, which is highly evidenced in the final act of the film.On a side note, the movie was shot on a \"prosumer\" grade Canon XL-1 camera, which shows that anyone with $4,000 and a lot of free time and free actors can make a great film.</td><td>rw1134201</td><td>Good low budget indie film, a tad disturbing though</td><td>edcrosay</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 2)</td><td>976-Lars (2005)</td><td>9</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>Extremely saturated with perverted, dry (at times wet) humor.

Pollard has created a sure-footed send-up of modern romance and what happens when devotion goes over the edge. Camera-work and settings around Kentucky were beautiful, creating a different spin from the constant romance-in-a-big-town-between-overeducated-professionals genre we all know too well.Story splits its time between David (Gil Bellows of \"Ally McBeal\" & \"Shawshank Redemption\"), a popular (and married) local radio talk-show host and Melody (Jennifer Westfeldt of \"Kissing Jessica Stein\"), an attractive pharmaceutical saleswoman traveling through town to see her boyfriend, Sean (Christian Kane, \"Angel\" & \"Friday Night Lights\"). David meets Melody by chance after she humiliates Sean by turning down his very public marriage proposal. As a friendship develops between the two, we learn than Sean's not going to give up so easily on Melody and that David's perfect life as upstanding pillar of the community may not be what it seems...Pollard deftly moves between romance, satire and unfolding mystery without ever letting his story run low on gas. The storyline is tight and the dialog is witty, funny and crisp. Realistic characters have to work around their warts, which creates a very funny commentary on marriage, dating and romantic obsession. Jennifer Westfeldt is particularly good at making a lot out of her neurotic beauty Melody, and she does look good here. Very nice use of multiple subplots and supporting characters (including \"Mike Hammer\" Stacy Keach and Elizabeth Pena of \"Jacob's Ladder\").

During those first few years it had characters living in different houses who could carry on independent story lines without interacting with their neighbours.

Maciste Alpino is funny, silly and quite well made, definitely improved by the advances in storytelling technique between 1914 and 1916. Maciste is the name of a secondary 'strongman/superman' character from Cabiria. He was so popular he was put into a ton of serials and films starring just his character. At the Breakout of World War I, this film was made to galvanize patriotic enthusiasm for the war. The film starts with Maciste and a company of filmmakers shooting a new Maciste film. Then they realize that war has broken out and they are arrested and sent to a concentration camp. It's not long before Maciste plans an escape and takes the camp with him. He joins up and they move into the mountains. There Maciste tracks down and captures a foreign commander and drags them down the mountain to much humorous effect. Then he leads his entire company over the mountain to rout the enemy. They come down the mountain into the backyard of a mansion where a damsel in distress is in danger of being ravished. Naturally, though Maciste doesn't know of her, Maciste leads the charge through defenses three times their numbers and just manages to save the girl at the last moment. Hurrah for Maciste, the end.It's a pretty good film, slow in some parts but an enjoyable silent film. Maciste's character is quite charismatic to watch, in fact he looks quite a lot like the wrestler The Rock. The plot is thin and makes the whole war seem minor and silly, but it's an enjoyable film and more watchable than Cabiria because the technique is much more sophisticated.</td><td>rw1134207</td><td>Italian star Maciste is thrown in a concentration camp at the start of World War I.

Being a fan of 70s horror in general, I was a big fan of House of 1000 Corpses when it came out. For all the major bashing it took for its campiness, borrowing from other sources, and pseudo-art house aspirations, I found it to be enjoyable, simple horror that didn't take the genre TOO seriously, without being mean spirited. When I sat down in the theater for The Devil's Rejects, I wasn't really prepared for the genius bit of cinema Rob Zombie created. While the touches of camp humor and over the top violence linger, the film itself was beautiful, multi-layered, and unique.While Corpses set up the deranged Firefly family as a stock group of serial killers, straight out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, TDR refined the characters, making for a movie that was much more realistic. Sheri Moon drops the annoying cackle this time around, in favor of sly deviousness and frantic bloodlust as Baby. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding becomes the villain everyone suspected he was in Corpses, while providing most of the movie's comic relief. But it is Bill Mosely who is the true standout as Otis Driftwood. While the Otis of the previous installment is terrifying at times, many of his mannerisms and lines are derivative of Charles Manson, pushing the boundaries from crazy to just plain funny (the lines about \"scooping ice cream for s**theel friends\" still makes me crack up). This humor is mostly gone from Otis. He is dark, deranged, and murderous, but the love and protection he offers to his \"family\" truly challenged me as a viewer, and awed me to Mosely's subtle and amazing performance. Granted, he still has a few great, hilarious lines, specifically one referencing that OTHER madman in theaters right now, Willy Wonka.Aside from the Firefly clan, the supporting cast is terrific. William Forsythe is powerful and chilling as the sheriff driven by his brother's murder to enact revenge just as grisly as the Fireflys' crimes. The gang from \"Banjo & Sullivan\" are utterly believable and help create some of the film's most haunting moments. Ken Foree is a delight to genre fans who will recognize him as the young cop in the original Dawn of the Dead, here portraying a struggling pimp with ties to Captain Spaulding. Danny Trejo and Diamond Dallas Page provide some truly sleazy moments as the Unholy Two, bounty hunters who are just as amoral as their prey. A truly stellar ensemble cast indeed.Rob Zombie nearly upstages this cast, however, with a script and style as visceral as the grittiest of 70s slasher originals (Last House on the Left, the Hills Have Eyes, and Texas Chainsaw all come to mind). Make no mistake, the Firefly family is vicious, unrepentant, and probably deserve the worst punishments Sheriff Wydell has in mind. They are rapists, killers, and sadists; in short, they are the darkest heart of America, and humanity itself. Why then do we pull for them? Why yearn for their escape? This is what puzzled and confused me, challenged me to think, and in short why I left the Devil's Rejects speechless. While some complained that it was not really scary, I found it truly frightening; that Rob Zombie could give a glimpse into the darkest acts of human depravity and still find some kinship with the perpetrators of such evil scared me. Unlike the over the top killers of House... this Firefly clan has bonds as strong as any family, and scant remnants of redemption beneath layers of evil.Visually, the film is stunning. Stark without being clichéd, Zombie pulls no punches and delivers a haunting vision of the heart of America. While some have complained it is \"not a real horror film,\" Zombie's vision is more frightening than any pilfered Americanized Japanese horrors of the past few years. Cannot come more highly recommended from a fan of the genre. If you're prepared to take a chance and be repulsed and drawn in to a world of depravity, see the Devil's Rejects.</td><td>rw1134210</td><td>Surprised? Certainly. Astounded?

First off I would not classify this as a horror flick, it was more of a thriller/western/revenge film. The devil's reject group was more subdued this film, less killing, not to dramatic when they killed first lady all the way to the lady running with her husbands face on hers. I mean hell when tiny escapes at the beginning (avoids being captured) you know hes going to do something in the end to help the TDR out. That and the only people I would classify in this film as psychos were otis and the sheriff, they did most of the killing. I have to hand it to the lady who played Mother firefly she was acting like a total nut/psycho and it was great all the way til she got hers really made he character believable. Baby just sucked, no laughing, just acting like a 8 year old most of the time (plus being able to throw that knife through that ladies chest plate, crap!!!). Captian spaulding was pretty much the same character from the first although he seems to have it more together in this film, plus it showed hes not above harpooning whales. Otis was more like a lunitic woodsmen with that beard of his. The sheriff reminded me of some crusader nutjob who was just as violent, but somehow holy. But other than that most of the characters were just to bland to be remembered, too static. Hell I didn't even remember the bands that was killed nor the people killed, or why I should have even cared about what happened to them.Too much of this movie just did not sit well with me, it just wasn't what I was looking for. I would say i liked HOTC more because of the pure violence and satism (I know zombies not a Satan lover, besides that stuffs BS) That and bullcrap \"we got the drop on you\" then messed it all up.Hopefully Mr. Zombie keeps making films he seems like hes caught onto the right track to revived horror moviesl, though next time leave out the god damn 5 min montage at the end.</td><td>rw1134213</td><td>western/thriller</td><td>altrgod</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(5, 12)</td><td>The Devil's Rejects (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>Oh yeah kiddies... this is one sick, twisted, vile and depraved movie..FINALLY!

In a way, Rob Zombie's second film, 'The Devil's Rejects', affected me the same way his music does- it's usually self-indulgent, stylized like it's nobody's business, and at times its fairly entertaining stuff, but you know while you're listening to it there's better material in the genre. His first film, 'House of 1000 Corpses', was below average for my tastes, as he reveled in the fact that he was a writer/director of a horror film by making a Oliver Stone-esquire pastiche of the genre. This time around, he goes for a more conventional narrative, though saying that one must take into account that its in the framework of a raw, un-hinged, demented, exploitation crime film. So, there are some good points about it, if muddled under by the flaws.As with 'Corpses', the film is style over substance, or story- the characters from the last film, the 'Fireflies' (led by Sid Haig, in a cheerfully disturbing performance), are on the lam from Texas troopers, most particularly the vengeful Sheriff (played by William Forsythe, overplayed for good and bad results) who'll stop at nothing to see they pay for their crimes. On the way to hideout among friends (one of which Ken Foree, one of several obvious nods Zombie makes to past exploitation/horror films with cameos and small parts), they continue the carnage. While watching the film though, one isn't as concerned with any real story as much as just the atmosphere, the fiends and victims who populate this late 1970's hillbilly environment Zombie has sprung up.The good parts are these- Zombie shows himself to be fairly adept at writing scathingly (and I mean scathingly like a iron to the face) witty dialog at times, mostly tongue-in-cheek, and has moments of inspired wild-ness in his style. He also has the good knowledge to let his actors go as nuts as possible, which helps at times to heighten the mood. But this leads into the bad sides of the film, one which some won't be bothered by (mostly die-hards I'd figure to exploitation flicks of the 70's) and some may be even more repulsed by than me: the Fireflys are, by Zombie's manipulation, by default the most sympathetic characters of the movie (when compared to the 'evil' police that is, and the innocuous victims). The problem is, despite some attempts to make them charming by some stretch, to get a viewer on the side of the anti-heroes, he doesn't succeed on this level.During parts of the film, including the ending scene (I won't reveal it, but to give an idea of the scene it's done with Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' blaring out), I started to think about another filmmaker who's gone in the realm of the take-no-prisoners, on the side of the outlaws film-making, Quentin Tarantino. He's not a filmmaker immune to criticism, but in the sort of side-world he's created with From Dusk till Dawn and the Kill Bill films (connected by some similar characters) the anti-heroes have a kind of balance with their more sadistic and 'bad' side to get a viewer rooting for them almost. Zombie is so in love with his style of film-making and these people he's created, that he doesn't realize that these aren't very charming people at all (bullies and children almost all the way through), and as the film heads towards a climax, it's hard to really root for anyone. Maybe that's the point, as a satire, but I just didn't get it, and by the big finale on a road in Texas, the whole experience of the film felt a little, well, average when in regards to the other 'shock' films Zombie pays tribute to.In short, the excesses that Zombie went with in 'Corpses' have sort of lingered on in 'Rejects', and while there are some curious and 'cool' bits scattered about (along with a very good classic/souther-rock soundtrack), it becomes a little boring at times too. I'm sure after this film that Zombie may make more movies, better ones perhaps, but with 'Rejects' he has made an uncompromising, violent, torrid, amusing, and ludicrous work here that does everything to call attention to itself...akin to his solo music work. It's the kind of film I can recommend more to some than others.</td><td>rw1134216</td><td>I got pretty much what I expected- slightly improved film-making from Zombie's first film, but...</td><td>Quinoa1984</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(6, 16)</td><td>Bad News Bears (2005)</td><td>8</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>Billy Bob Thornton pulled off what no one other then the late Walter matthau could do, and that's play failed baseball player Morris Buttermaker to a bunch of rag tag kids.

The barbs trading back between Amanda and Buttermaker are funny, as THornton has a great screen chemistry with his younger co star. Not suing Kelly Leak in the original, and not having the classic Rudy Stein characters are a few of the drawbacks,as is not using Amhad's hank Arron loving character (this time around Admand's favorite player is Mark McGwire, who the producers decided correctly to make a punchline) but the biggest drawback is Greg Kinnear as the Yankee's coach. Years removed from battling Ben Stiller to pull off the worst performance in the 1998 crapfest Mystery Men, Kinnear is stiff, not believable, and pretty much close to effeminate. kinnear almost pulls the whole movie down by himself with his wooden performance. While no one can even touch the late Vic Morrow's portrayal in 76, Kinnear's performance in terrible, and him being casted in the role is outright unacceptable. Tanner Boyle was thankful toned down from the 1976 classic, and is no longer spoutting racist words. He still manages , however, to be the team's badass with a mouth that would make sailor's blush. And he's absolutely funny at it as well, and is perhaps acting talent on the Bears roster.

Forget every other film he's made and let's get to this one.Far more intellectual than what you might expect, don't be surprised if your mind does not occasionally start to dwell on debates of morality and what makes a human being, well, a human being. There are harsh criticisms made about our society and our human nature to the point that you will find yourself demonizing most of the human characters and identifying with the pure, selfless and ideal nature of the protagonists. Our heroes are after all, basically children and therefore have an uncorrupted view of right and wrong, and act on those impulses accordingly. There are some very ugly reminders of what man has been capable in the service of his own selfish objectives, and man's capacity to rationalize the persecution or extermination of other humans and animals as either necessary or because the obstacles are less than human in their eyes. We are quite literally even reminded of the horrors of the Holocaust in a harrowing incinerator scene. We further have our our recall stimulated of another recent act of inhumanity when a major character speaks of a their parents part in resisting the warlords victimizing civilians in Africa. All pretty heavy stuff from the guy who directed the BAD BOY movies. Now, make no mistake, this is still Bay spectacle stuff here, but even much of that has the unique feeling of real and tangible. The cities seem functionaland one conceivable in the near future. There is not a lot of incomprehensible techno jargon to bombard you either. Even the chases, clearly inspired by other action films themselves (even Bay references himself here) seem fresh and clever. It's worth the ticket price.

Extras is a lot more of a trad. sitcom than 'The Office', but I detected potential for a lot of (dark) drama as well as comedy - including pathos and bathos, and possibly some other things ending in athos.This episode had several laugh out loud scenes, with exquisite dialogue. The set-pieces are there, like 'The Office', and work very well, even though we're just getting to know the characters. Ben Stiller is *very* good as the self obsessed star director. I expect it's just good acting.Gervais' character is a witty, clever-ish guy, who is, none the less, a loser. His friend Maggie shows potential as another grotesque creation; she just cannot hide her gut reaction to people and situations, so often puts her foot in it. A sort of Godber figure then, counselled by Gervais' Fletcher. I suppose that makes Ben Stiller Mr MacKay?

Renzo Montagnani basically plays the same part in both films, but in this one it is Edwige Fenech, not Paola Senatore, who goes sunbathing while he does his gay butler act. Giacomo D'Amato (Renzo) is picked up by widowed countess Magda (Juliette Mayniel) the moment he's released from jail and promptly leaves his girlfriend standing there (remember-her-for-later-on alert). Magda wants Renzo to pose as a butler/chauffeur and seduce her brothers new wife Ines (who is Renzo's ex lover), so Magda can have the inheritance all for herself.Ines (Susan Scott) is already having late night rendezvous with Magda's teenage son Marco (Roberto Censi and his trademark bad hair cut) and sees through the new Major Domo's gay disguise immediately. Finally Edwige arrives in green hot-pants on her scooter, proving to be an illegitimate love child of the crippled Count by showing the mole on her behind (the other blood relatives join her in the buttock line). As usual, Fenech waists no time and takes off her top for the aforementioned sun bathing scene, arousing the interest of Giacomo and Marco and objections from Ines.As if all this wasn't confusing enough, the whole family keeps double and triple crossing each other to get into good graces with the Count. There is photographic evidence of adulterous affairs, a kidnap plot is foiled before the ransom note is dry, the blonde girlfriend from the start is suddenly the new maid, and a young cook who only appeared once or twice in the background suddenly moves in to seduce Edwige into a lesbian encounter (implied, not shown). Meanwhile Renato's gay act keeps getting more obnoxious (cringe as he hilariously vacuums Freddy Mercury style). When the time comes to go into the accusing parlour for the not so surprising final will and testament, most viewers will have stopped caring about these characters already.5 out of 10</td><td>rw1134221</td><td>This family will try anything short of incest</td><td>Chip_douglas</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 1)</td><td>The Island (2005)</td><td>7</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>As a first-time outing without the overadrenalized Jerry Bruckheimer, 'The Island' comes off as a well considered project. While few of the ideas posited in this new film are 'new', Bay and screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have done a more than serviceable job of recycling ideas from other movies that arrived D.O.A.'The Island' is of course a remake of 'Parts:The Clonus Horror', one of the most sordid of D-grade Mystery-Science Theater 3000 candidates - 'Coma' made on a budget of $350,000. Straight-to-video? Straight-to-the-SciFi Channel? Not even close. Even Albert Pyun never managed to stink 'em up this bad - though he came close, many a time.But I'm supposed to be talking 'The Island' here, and not 'The Clonus Horror'. The Island' is a good movie, built on a solid script, excellent production values and sound performances delivered by A-list actors. As I sat in the theater watching this movie, I found myself going through a mental checklist, \"'Logan's Run', check. 'The Island of Dr. Moreau', check. 'Brave New World', check. 'Revenge of the Sith', check. There are even shades of 'Total Recall' and 'Gattaca' buried in here, as the film is a dystopia-buried-in-a-futuristic-consumer-fantasy kind of flick. The question remains, though - was this picture brought to fruition by Michael Bay, or just one of the higher-ups at Dreamworks SKG - SKG as in Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen.Ewan MacGregor redeems himself here, for the 6 years he spent trying to imitate Alec Guiness in the woebegone 'Star Wars' prequels. There's a wonderful long moment in the film where we're reminded he was once Scottish - 'Shallow Grave', 'Trainspotting' anyone? And OMG! Scarlett Johansson is actually a fairly attractive woman - I really couldn't tell before, with her abused girlfriend and serfdom turns in 'Lost In Translation' and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. Again, who knew? But the former Director Bay manages to shine through in some areas, with his signature explosions and oddballs in the supporting cast: Steve Buscemi, showing greater range than evidenced before, demeans himself once again, while Ethan 'Neelix' Philips shows up to disgrace himself as a roly-poly balding-on-top Stryker refugee.For shame! Is it possible to have a Michael Bay movie without cartoonish archetypes? Michael Mann got over it - I suggest that Bay get ahold of the manual and further his attempts at meaningful content. There may be something more memorable than 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor' in Bay's future.

She's amazing. And she and Amitabh still do the couple thing well. I can't really decide if he's better with Jaya or Sharmila. He's such a great actor, he can turn it on and off whenever the director says \"action\".The story is about an Indian boy who goes to a party, sees a woman shot, and decides to intervene. Huge mistake. The shooter is the son of the Home Minister, and before the struggle is over the, boy (Amar, son of Vidhya) has been fatally shot himself. He had JUST been properly married by his parents to Jenny, his love who is English. Of course the whole family and all its friends is totally convulsed, including Jenny who has seen her husband snatched away by death on the wedding day itself.Well, the whole rest of the movie is about the struggle of Vidhya to get justice for his dead son. It is narrated by the ghost of Amar (more ghosts, ghosts seem all over the place in Bollywood). The theme of the movie is that when powerful people commit heinous crimes, Justice becomes not only blind but deaf and cold-hearted.There are so many nice performances in this movie, its impossible to remember them all. Sanjay Dutt plays a mechanic who buys the building next to Vidhya's house and does noisy repair work when Vidhya and Sumi are taking an afternoon nap. There is a lot of conflict at first, but eventually they all become best friends. It becomes important to the plot.John Abraham. Man he is GREAT as the faithful and respectful son. I know this won't make him give up his \"bad boy\" persona, but now fans know he has two (or more) dimensions. Jenny is played by Anusha Dhandekar who did an item number in the Rahul Bose-Perizaad Zorabian movie Mumbai Matinée. Her English accent (assuming someone didn't dub the movie) gives me to believe she is NRI. In any case, she is bahut bahut cute! She reminds me of a more familiar actress but I can't think of whom.It is not a very musical movie, so don't expect that.

The problem is that Liz Goldwyn inserts herself into the story, and takes it over with her misguided attempts to do striptease, something that she has neither the looks nor the body for.I mean, if you want to strip, it helps if you have actual curves. This woman needed to go on the all-ButterBurger diet for a month. But it's not her anorexic frame that's the problem here. It's her ego-tripping, wrongheaded approach to the subject that torpedoes this project. Despite having one of the Maysles as her cinematographer, she violates all the rules of documentary film-making, and misses the point time and again.The interviews are great, and funny in spite of the filmmaker, who keeps trying to insert her third wave feminist rhetoric into their life stories. Whereas the strippers themselves are very matter-of-fact about their careers, Goldwyn keeps trying to tell them how they \"owned their sexuality.\" When the women tell her about the raincoat crowd masturbating under newspapers while the dancers did their bump-and-grind, her reaction is priceless: \"How dare they!,\" she says, adding, \"That's not what it was about...It was about witticism...Empowerment.\" No, it was about women taking their clothes off and guys wanking to it. As one of the strippers says, \"We were the poor man's brothel.\" If Goldwyn has a problem with guys beating off to strippers, she needn't worry that anyone will be masturbating to the striptease number she performs at the end of the film.Zorita, a stripper who often used a snake in her act, has a lot of the best lines. Goldwyn keeps asking Zorita about her lesbianism. When she asks what use Zorita had for men, the response is classic: \"A hairy chest and a limp joint. Who needs it?\" At another point, when teaching the fan dance to the clueless filmmaker, Zorita tells her, \"You're queer for asses.\" Anyway, there's some worthwhile stuff to be found here, but there could have been so much more if not for the overprivileged and undertalented Goldwyn and her lame, Women's Studies take on classic striptease.Oh yeah -- she also loses points for using David Bowie's \"Oh!

There are the inevitable complications, but in the end, the girl gets her man (or vice versa, depending on one's point of view).

Shot in 1947, we get to see - and hear - such fine artists as the charming and talented singer June Christy, drummer Shelly Manne, bass player Eddie Safranski, tenor sax player Bob Cooper and the many other superb musicians that made up Kenton's powerhouse band.

Devoid of the healthy budgets pumped into his commercial films of 30 years ago, Franco's new shot-on-video productions are fueled not so much by cash and imagination but by poverty and hallucination. Franco no longer worries about such basics as plot or character development, he moves from scene to scene creating one unbelievable moment and then another, not necessarily caring if the plot or story has moved forward, backward, sideways or completely off the wall. It is as though what's on the screen at the moment is all that matters, what came before or what comes next is anybody's guess -- even Franco's.One Shot Productions is not, as many have claimed, a bunch of fans paying for Franco's filmed fantasies. The production company seems to enjoy allowing Senor Franco to pull the cinematic wool over unsuspecting viewers eyes time after time. VAMPIRE JUNCTION, for example, takes an inexplicable mix of characters (cowboys, doctors, acrobatic nudist vampires, a Dracula-wannabee, drunks, etc.) and tosses them all into a tourist trap of an old West ghost town and allows them all to shake up against one another for 90 minutes or so. Who knows what happens or why? Seeing nubile naked vampettes walking backwards on all fours like spiders while chubby old sheriffs are taking pot shots at old Scratch as we listen to the town drunk warbling nonsense while sitting on a hobby horse isn't supposed to make sense to anyone but Jesus Franco. Naturally, Lina Romay, with her prime deep in her rear-view mirror, wanders through the proceedings trying to solve whatever mystery the director has foisted on the story.And it's as though Franco is daring you to try to understand or even try to enjoy anything he puts in front of you.Many people hate Franco's films and some post vapid commentary on the IMDb or in chat rooms or forums about why he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a camera. The director and his producers must laugh at those comments all the way to their respective banks. I don't think Franco is going to be appreciated by his contemporaries or even by the grandchildren of his contemporaries. Jess is so off the map that only his true fans who can read the subliminal threads from film to film can truly enjoy his latter day output. For the rest of us, we can push around the tea leaves and embrace the rare -- but always present -- moment of exhilarated genius and wait for the next Franco film or video that will exasperate us no matter how prepared for it we will be.And, as usual, we'll laugh at the doubters and naysayers, and we'll make believe we understand the canvas Franco is creating for us.</td><td>rw1134234</td><td>Part of the New Wave of Jesus Franco</td><td>pelly</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(3, 3)</td><td>Peppi en Kokki (1973–1978)</td><td>null</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>Even in the seventies Peppi and Kokki were a throwback to an era long gone.

Each week they would try out a new job and Kokki would eventually botch it up (unless there was food involved, then the blame was on Peppi) whether they were firemen, cooks, stagehands, shopkeepers or detectives. All the action was accompanied by a single piano, with the unmistakable sound of Joop Stokkermans tickling the ivory.You see this was shot like a silent movie, except for narration by Prins Tor van Sombrië himself, Will van Selst (and Bob Verstraete before him). It's funny to hear the all knowing narrator speak old fashioned correct KRO Dutch, proving once again how much times have changed. Later on, having exhausted every job imaginable, they would just stay home on their boat Alma and bother a neighbour called Buurman Beer and his wife Madelief every Saturday afternoon. Occasionally there would have a multi part story, the longest being \"Pepi en Kokki bij de Marine\" which somehow merited a cinema release. Aimed at pre-schoolers the pace is almost unbearably slow, making the 15 minute running time seem twice as long. The two mock-sailors finally called it quits just shy of one hundred episodes but still kept on touring the country. Eventually Kokki had enough and went looking for more grown up acting jobs (reappearing as a sleazy character on the popular sitcom \"Zeg 'ns Aaa\").

Nelson) seems an average guy who works in an insurance agency, and lives a \"normal\" mediocre life with his wife Helen and three kids: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. But there's more to it, actually. Bob used to be Mr. Incredible, and Helen was Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), two of the world's greatest crime fighters until a series of lawsuits have forced superheroes to adopt civilian identities. But when Bob receives a mysterious call that has him for a top secret assignment, he sees this as an opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again. He accepts the mission but soon discovers that it is a trap of a nemesis from way back, and the whole family eventually has to to join him to fight evil and save the world.What we have here is something that unfortunately becoming quite a rare thing nowadays: an example of a truly brilliant animation. As I have said, not only does it have some of the most phenomenal computer graphics and action sequences ever committed to film, but like all the best movies it also has the heart to support the movie between the adrenaline-pumping moments. The main reason for this is the great characterization. \"The Incredibles\" may contain a little too much of violence that may be better suited for older children than the younger ones. Yet one cannot easily discount the family themes and comic episodes, with characters like superhero-costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird) and Bob's friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) providing ample support. Another is that the film, as is with previous Pixar films, is effective in the use of computer generated images (CGI) which is a major plus for moviegoers. The details in which the animators for the film present are awe-inspiring and breathtaking. The music also pasted itself impeccably with the atmosphere Bird has created for the film. Very retro.It is a demonstration of precision and excellence, created by the brilliance and meticulous mannerisms of the director. It goes beyond an animated movie and is without a doubt one of the best animations of all time. It is truly incredible to see a film like this.</td><td>rw1134240</td><td>Incredible in every sense of it!</td><td>Jay_Exiomo</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>Frank Leaves for the Orient (1999– )</td><td>null</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>i caught this last night in comedy central's 'on demand' library, and was oddly attracted to it. it wasn't side-splittingly funny, but i just couldn't take my eyes off of it. it reminds me of what a less funny and live action Family Guy would be. basic storyline--with random scenes spliced within it. thats pretty much how it was set up. however not as funny as family guy, it had its moments. its quirkiness attracted me to it, as well as its cheap low-budget feel. i can see how it didn't last too long, but i had never heard of it until last night, i wish it had gotten some more time to be seen. i wonder what will happen to it now. it gave me hope. worth a look if your up late at night and bored out of your mind.</td><td>rw1134242</td><td>live action Family Guy but less funny</td><td>n0rmnbates</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(7, 13)</td><td>The Godfather (1972)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is \"The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces\" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the \"Corleone Family Mafia\". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.I highly recommend this movie.</td><td>rw1134243</td><td>The Greatest, no questions asked</td><td>SeminolePhenom</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 5)</td><td>Finding Neverland (2004)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Johnny Depp, after this movie, is now my favorite actor.

The casting for the FF themselves was spot-on, and the film develops their personalities and relationships brilliantly. This is also the film's only real flaw - although the scenes showing how the Four adapt to their new-found powers and how they relate to each other are enjoyable, too much time is spent on this and not enough on developing the adventure itself. Victor von Doom's transformation to the evil Dr Doom is done fairly well, but Doom himself doesn't really come across as the towering evil genius you expect from the comics. There is none of the egomaniacal posturing or the grand \"Who dares to challenge the magnificence of Doom?\" type lines we've all come to know and love from the comic books. Overall, though, the film was a pleasant surprise and well worth watching for anyone who has read the comics.

OK yes, the CGI is, as you'd expect these days, stunning, and the film is probably worth watching for that aspect alone if you're into that sort of stuff. As to the non-CGI aspects of the film, it's a rather tedious affair with predictable humour and uninspired dialogue. Not even close to the wit and originality of your average Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner cartoon (of course, those were brilliant so I suppose that's an unfair comparison, since no one these days seems able to write with that level of flair or originality). I find when viewing these sorts of films that it helps to imagine what they would be like if the images were all hand-drawn as in the pre-computer days. Would the film still hold your interest? In most cases, no. Still, Madagascar is probably a good way to entertain the kids for an hour and a bit, but you should probably bring along some mental baggage of your own to keep your mind occupied, since this film won't do it for you.</td><td>rw1134249</td><td>Predictable humour</td><td>growe</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(11, 20)</td><td>Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)</td><td>1</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Seeing this movie reminds me of the saying 'You can't kick a bark out of a dead dog.' That being said, this movie seems so forced in its attempts to be everything to everyone that it doesn't achieve any one particular aspect very well. The drama presented between characters is oddly placed when thinking of what kind of care they movie attempts to make you have for them. Basically, the character interaction is stagnant, with some contractually obligated hints at Anakin's angst or whatever, until such time as the obvious crescendo is is reached and signals another stagnant character interaction. There is nothing that makes you care what happens between Anakin and the ex-Queens relationship, save for an excuse to fart out some of the most forced and/or disinterested acting in Hollywood... and that says a lot. Normally that wouldn't directly make a movie abysmally bad if it has action or other redeeming entertainment value (like special effects), but all the pomp in this film cannot save it from the commitment the movie requires you to invest. It's long, long and cheesy. The movies cares little to present Anakins inner turmoil, and if it gives reason for it, it doesn't bother to make it a focal point. If an audience isn't made to care about the characters inner developments, then how are they supposed to care about the cliché twists and turns it attempts to make? If you don't care about the characters, something the original trilogy succeeded in, you aren't going to care when Padame has twins in a minute and spits out both their names in the same breath. What? Why'd she pick those names? Was she looking for the first thing that came to her head? WHy didn't Lucas have enough sense to foreshadow an influence for her name ideas. All this would seem moot if the scene wasn't supposed to be so important in the entire saga. ANakin, as well is presented as a plastic 2 dimensional character, and I say 2 dimensional, because the film tries to fart out a sorry excuse of struggle of good and evil within him which basically consists in him saying the appropriate lines to tell us which side he is leaning on at the moment. Rubbish! And when he converts he is reduced to the one dimensional archetype tattered super-villain we have all seen before. The only relation I had with this film was when Vader gets off his operation table and shouts in the worst and most unconvincing 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO' I have seen in a film since your favorite Ed Wood film, and the reason for this connection is that that is what i was screaming in my head during this entire picture. I wasn't expecting much in the first place. The first two prequels were horrible, with an amusing battle scene at the end of part II, but this film is exactly what Star Wars film shouldn't be - Star Trek parading around as Star Wars.I think, with all sincerity, that Lucas' new Star Wars 'vision' (starting with his hacking the originals with horrible cabaret scenes and needless animations) is the product of a mid-life crisis. It is not his fault that the best STar Wars film wasn't directed by him (Empire Strikes Back), but there is no reason for garbage like this save for lining your pockets with the money of nostalgic Star Wars fans and their kids. And although, i have a fondness for the originals, and i have that nostalgia too, I am glad I didn't get suckered into paying 7 bucks for this trash. I downloaded it off the internet.

There Alberich is the brother of Mime and the (one of the)biggest villain of the story. He takes the gold from the Rhine ladies but curses it if he has to give it to Wotan. Wotan wants to pay Fasolt and Fafner for the building of the Wallhalla with it. They however fight for it and Fafner kills Fasolt and turns into a Dragon to guard the Gold. Wagner changes the story mainly because he was influenced by Schopenhauers Philosophy and his, then new, Socialistic thoughts. Sieglinde and Siegmund are twins and both children from Wotan. Siegfried is Wotans grandson and he is only born because of Wotans greed. He is in need of a hero who can bring the Nibelung treasure (In fact he is only interested in the Ring) back to him. Hagen is indeed Alberichs son in Wagners opera. Wih Wagner, Mime is a bad person who tries to kill Siegfries who then kills him. at the end Brünhilde jumps into the flames, thus ending her life and burning the Wallhalla and the Gods in it. (Götterdämmerung) So there are several parallels between the movie and Wagners operas. Tolkien didn't like Wagner, because of the way he changed the old stories of both the Edda and the Nibelungenlied. But in fact they share the same inspiration. Now, for a movie who most concurrent with Wagner, Tolkien and Peter Jackson, I think it isn't bad at all. The only trouble to me is that, by changing the story in Richard Wagners way it promises a moral dimension which it doesn't bring.</td><td>rw1134257</td><td>Good Movie but more after Wagner than after the Myth</td><td>music_ed_29</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 2)</td><td>Sin City (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Sin City is the delightful and devilish idea from the mind of imaginative Frank Miller. The remake of the comic is stylish film noir at its best. This sexy movie weaves three stories into one but each story has one thing in common: they're all in Basin City - a place infested with crooked cops, gangs and prostitutes. The first story is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis) - the rogue cop, one man absolutely determined to save a little girl from the hands of a sexual predator. The second is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke), an apeish ex-con wishing to avenge the murder of his beloved Golde. Lastly, the gorgeous Dwight (Clive Owen) - a guy just wanting to look out for his barmaid girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) but ends up in a war between crooked cops and prostitutes, lead by Gail (Rosario Dawson).The performances were outstanding. Mickey Rourke shone as Marv, and Benicio Del Toro plays a great Jackie Boy. Bruce Willis and Clive Owen both put in solid performances for their respective characters. I was surprised at Brittany Murphy's performance, which in my opinion was definitely her best. Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba (Nancy) and Jaime King (Wendy/Golde) all put in sexy performances. The only disappointing performance was by Alexis Bledel (Becky) - I felt her a little flat and one dimensional, but this did not detract from the movie.The best thing about this movie was the bold, stylish and VERY daring cinematography. It is shot in black and white, with splotches of colour every now and again (a red dress, blue eyes, etc.). I wouldn't be surprised if this movie got a few Oscars under its belt for this alone. The movie borders into fantasy, but never quite makes that step, which is a bold move by Rodriguez. The heroes do not wear capes, don't fly or have special powers, but there is something unnatural about them that is never explained.The movie was an accurate representation of the comics, and I believe is a masterpiece of modern popular culture.

Some other fun characters show up, but aren't fleshed out at all, even Vince's psycho-stalker gets one good character line at the end, when there was so much more to be said.

I remember watching it with him and remembered some key parts, but almost none of the plot. There's a reason for that: there's no real plot to remember.Here's the basic plot. A life-long Stoogemaniac by the name of Howard F Howard (Stooge fans will get it) is trying to get married to his girlfriend. But the 3 Stooges are taking over his life as he sees their movies wherever he goes. He runs out during the wedding and goes to live on Stooge Alley: where all the Stoogemaniacs live. This is apparently a newly discovered affliction that causes you to whoop and holler while slapping your Stooge friends. The Stooge center comes ala the men in white coats and pick up the Stoogemaniacs. They put them through a deprogramming system to get them off the Stooges, but in the end it fails as the Stoogemaniacs declare their love in a giant free-for-all pie fight. The movie ends with Howard getting married, with his Stooge friends on hand.That's literally the entire plot. Most of it is used as a set up to show clips from 3 or 4 public domain Stooge films. Frankly it would be a lot better and more enjoyable to just watch the films by themselves, as 99% of the stuff in between is unfunny garbage. Plus you wouldn't have to watch the same jokes repeated half a dozen different times in the same movie.The acting sucks, as you would imagine. The only one that might even get a chuckle out of you is Sid Ceasar. But really, what is there to work with? The directing is simple, as it's only needed to set up the next Stooges clip. Two different scenes in two different buildings are shot in the same obviously refurnished room, and the hallway they had on set was used many different times. Probably the most notable things in the movie are the surprise appearances of James Avery (Uncle Phil on Fresh Prince of Bel Air) and Victoria Jackson (SNL). A somewhat skinny James Avery plays an orderly in the institute, and an even skinnier Victoria plays a nurse. She even gets to do one of her famous handstands during the pie fight.Bottom line, this movie is bad. I know hardcore Stooge fans will probably want to see it, but all I can tell you is that it's not worth it. I just rewatched my dad's old copy for this review, and I've gotta say the only reason I'm not chucking/selling/burning it is because I have a feeling it's pretty hard to find.

That was as far as I could watch before I gave up.With the exceptions of 'Into the Sun' & 'Half Past Dead' stay away from anything Segal made after 'Exit Wounds'.

That's a lot considering he only starred in 13 films from 1988-2002.It's a shame that he is mass producing crap when 'Into the Sun' proved he can still make a good movie when he cares enough about it. 1 of 10 - This one should only be watched by those who refuse to miss a Segal movie and even then I ask why?</td><td>rw1134267</td><td>What's with the crack addict, wall crawling, ninja-monkeyman barber?</td><td>Jipper2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 9)</td><td>13 Seconds (2003 Video)</td><td>8</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>You have got to check this out!

Its his newest film released on DVD and I have very mixed emotions about it. I liked it because the camera effects were cool and the action was good and then I didn't like it. I'll go through the good and the bad below.THE GOOD 2 OK: The fights: YEAH!!! Steven Seagal fights Gary Daniels! Camera shots: The jumpy camera work was a cool feature to the movie.The actors: Steven Segal and Gary Daniels together in a film and they fight each other! Is this a sign that other well known martial arts actors will be in Seagal's future movies? William Hope and Vinny Jones have appearances. The two women were neat.THE BAD 2 WORST: Seagal's talking: He'd change his voice constantly to a light voice and then a deep voice and if that wasn't bad enough he'd change his accent like a southerner then to a cowboy and then back to the regular accent we're all used too. What the heck was up with that?The fights: There was only a couple but they were OK because they weren't long I mean extremely brief! Daniels was no match for Seagal as he got killed by Seagal. The big bodyguard guy was absolutely not even a sparing partner and the fight with him and Seagal! I mean dang it, a guy like that should have lasted longer! Nick Brimble: Was he trying be Jack Palance or thought he was him? Plot: It was confusing as everything just jumped around back and fourth, back and fourth! The color: The color kept on changing and changing! Why? The dialog: Examples: (Gary Daniels: I'm taking over this Submerine now! Steven Seagal: You're just gonna have to kill me I guess...) (Steven Seagal: Let me ask you a question. What kind of damn fool do you think I am? I'm still in prison for doing the same thing you're about to ask me to do again). I thought a lot of the dialog was funny and I laughed at most of it.The camera work: Why was there so much camera effects? It seemed funny because even when someone got killed they didn't fall like they should. Instead it seemed like they skipped a spaces and got to the ground earlier than you'd expect? The opera concert: Hopw the conductor looked up and here and there when guys were getting killed.Surely everything that seemed funny was unintentional? Right? There many other points I could point out but there are too many of them. You may consider this film to be one of those that are so bad is its films. I would only recommend this film to people who like unintentional hilarious moments in films and of course Seagal completest and hardcore fans.Movie Nuttball's NOTE: If you are big Steven Seagal fan like Me then I strongly recommend you to check out these other great movies!

This film definitely takes his character on the ride he was asking for, but the ending was not exactly what he had been expecting as an outcome.

The only movie I can think of that pulled it off is Mr Roberts.And then came Shrek, which uses pages from a bona fide book of fairy tales as toilet paper, shows the hero taking a slime shower and has maggots wriggling into place to create words  and that's only through the opening credits. Yet, after all that, and the candle made of ogre earwax and a donkey urinating out a campfire, it still manages the most poignantly beautiful scene ever committed to film as the hero and heroine contemplate their lives without each other to the accompaniment of Leonard Cohen's haunting Allelujah.Mike Meyers as the title ogre, Eddie Murphy as his talking donkey sidekick, Cameron Diaz as the enchanted princess and John Lithgow as the vertically challenged villain are all brilliant. The script and direction match their efforts. The animation is simply the best ever done (even to the point of replicating the red-point sun reflection off the camera lens as the heroes emerge from a tunnel). Fantasia eat your heart out.And it isn't just that this is the comedic equal of Arsenic and Old Lace and Young Frankenstein. Or that it is to animation what Citizen Kane was to cinematography. Or that, while creating the greatest of all fairy tales, it lampoons every one that came before it along with the Disney machine that put most of them on celluloid. It's greatest strength is that it's as societally important as Mr Smith Goes to Washington or To Kill a Mockingbird. Not all of us, in fact not many of us, grow up to be swans, and there's not a damn thing wrong with being an ugly duck.Shrek is irreverently funny in a way that delights everyone from bratty kids to insensitive old farts. It's scenes that attempt romantic beauty are the equal of any classic Disney fairy tale. It's message is the most important ever delivered by any story: no matter who or what you are, there's a place for you in this world and you have a right to be happy being you.</td><td>rw1134278</td><td>You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars.</td><td>clarkpark</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(42, 96)</td><td>Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Halloween III: The Season of the Witch is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Tom Atkins, Stacy Nelkin, Dan O'Herlihy, Michael Currie, Ralph Strait, Jadeen Barbor, Brad Schacter, Garn Stephens, Nancy Kyes, Jonathan Terry, Al Berry, Wendy Wessberg, Essex Smith, Maidie Norman, and Dick Warlock!

The story on the cover of this cheap DVD is not what you will see. But there is Lee Van Cleef all right. He is some kind of Mafia Don, and he looks meek, like some kind of a bookkeeper (which he apparently was in real life). For an escape from prison (it's a cinch!) he is given some workman's clothes, a half length blue coat and a blue peaked cap - and suddenly he looks like Lenin, and I mean the true Vladimir Illich on one of those kitschy Socialist Realism paintings. It is hilarious! The resemblance is so striking that it cannot be a coincidence.The story is not good  well, hardly existing, the editing is chaotic, the unrestored print used for the DVD occasionally badly scratched. But some scenes are really well directed, the acting, the set design and the photography are above average. As often in Italian movies of the period: interesting details, messy as a whole. The movie is principally a comedy. Tony Lo Bianco is hilarious as a small time pimp who thinks the Don is god (he plays a mixture of Roberto Benigni and Eric Roberts in Runaway Train). Van Cleef's adversary is played by Jean Rochefort, a great French character actor who more often plays roles in powdered wigs. There are elements of Film Noir, interesting interiors and lighting and a long and very funny car chase. It's the kind of movie that smart guys like Quentin Tarantino learned from, I guess.

It is one of those films film critics can boast about and actually be correct in saying it is \"brilliant...dont miss it\". \"Leaving las Vegas\" is perfect in every single aspect. Finest acting - Cage earns the title of super-star actor in his meticulous performance of a terminal alcoholic. Shue is unprecedented in her role of downtrodden prostitute with a heart of gold, It is extremely disappointing she hasn't continued her acting as much or in as much distinguished roles. Beyond efficient directing by Figgis (also screen-writer) who's journey to super-stardom has arguably been a downward spiral from here. Figgis is one of the handful of directors who not only understands what he is writing but possesses the ability to convey it to others without being lost in translation. Some criticize his shaky, at times, claustrophobic filming but this merely compliments the story in an overall sense. I admire one such as he, who not only selects the films music but plays much of it himself. Another such great director is of course none other than the master Clint Eastwood. If its one thing this film didn't receive is the amount of recognition and acclaim it really deserved. Note only Cage received an academy award which he unequivocally deserved, but then so did Shue and Figgis. It really is the best film this narrator has seen in several decades. One can only hope that Figgis will retain such majesty and greatness in his story-telling and hopefully call back Cage and Shue for lead roles but no one can even consider repeating or even yet over-shadowing this film's beauty.

The photography is superb, and director Ophuls is served excellently by both James Mason and Joan Bennett. However the very linchpin of the story is the ambivalent and complex relationship between the blackmailer and his victim and it's in this area that the movie falters badly. It's handling of the relationship is straightforward, shallow and basically unbelievable. \"The Deep End\" handled this particularly well; it's the very source of the film's power. It also shrewdly updated the protection of a daughter by her mother, from having the love letters she wrote exposed, to a mothers protection of her gay son's videotaped sexual escapades.Still \"Reckless Moment\" remains a worthwhile experience, but misses making the grade of a \"classic\" thanks to an unimaginative, simplistic and shallow screenplay.</td><td>rw1134291</td><td>The Shallow End</td><td>grahamclarke</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 2)</td><td>National Treasure (2004)</td><td>8</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>This Film is really breathtakingly good, it is a very creative film with a lot of stunts and surprising plots.It has a very good story and Nicholas Cage really plays his character very good.The things that they have to do to resolve the puzzle, and the inventive it looks, i can only admire it.The film contains all the ingredients that a good film needs.

Don't watch it to be entertained though; what this film sets out to do is show you something unrelentingly grotesque. There is no gloss here, and no hope.Hollywood has a problem. Frequently we see \"powerful movies\" about the world's poorest and most down-and-out people. The problem is that in real life, the lives of the poorest and most-down-and out people are often banal and undramatic. The Hollywood answer is to inject redemption into the script in order to mask the stink of reality. The results is the Space Mountain of movies, a tamed-down roller coaster experience that deliberately pulls the punches to retain a family--or at least, a hopeful--atmosphere. There's nothing wrong with this approach as long as we remember that what we're seeing is a projection. The problem becomes when we start to believe our own myths.Night at the Golden Eagle is a film that shatters some of those myths. These are the lives of people most of us would rather forget, people with no hope, no future, and only shattered dreams to keep them company. It's rightfully disturbing stuff. Anyone looking to be entertained should stay far away, because Night is a film that is guaranteed to leave you feeling dirty.For all that, it never feels exploitive. Night draws you close to the stench of decay but never cheapens it. There are no false redemptions, no heroes charging in to save the day, not even an \"everyman\" to ease us into the proceedings, nor are any of the developments glamorized as they might be in a film by Tarantino and his ilk.This film is not perfect. It is so dank that it is almost overwhelming, and not quite close enough to a documentary to shake the need for plot. However, the sets and costumes are incredible. The acting ranges from fantastic to mediocre but never sinks to the level of a WB horror movie.Another reviewer mentioned \"racist\" content in this film and I am slightly inclined to agree, in that movies of this kind so frequently demonstrate the fall of a young white woman as synonymous with her sleeping with a black or Latino man. This is an example of a theme that might not be as jarring were not a prominent feature in at least 4 films released between 1999 and 2002.

Approximately two decades after the immensely popular Universal monster movies, the British Hammer studio gained their first SF/horror success with The Quatermass Experiment. In all honesty, it was the popularity of this, and only this Nigel Kneale adaptation that all of a sudden indicated that the audience's hunger for morbid tales and horrific effects was insatiable and Hammer cleverly exploited this given one step at the time, by re-telling other famous franchises. They begun with Frankenstein in 1957, but Dracula and The Mummy immediately followed during the next years. Terence Fisher's The Curse of Frankenstein revives the basic classic premise of Mary Shelley's story but adds a whole lot of horrific aspects that would later become the typical trademarks of the great Hammer production company. For example, the morality-lesson that nobody is entitled to play God and create life himself is not exaggeratedly obtruded like in most other Frankenstein adaptations and the creature's make-up is really monstrous for the very first time. Although, admittedly, that's also due to the fact that the original monster make up, worn by the legendary Boris Karloff as we all remember him, was copyright protected and simply not allowed to be imitated. But, most of all, Hammer implemented these and other minor modifications because their interpretation of the horror genre clearly was much more brutal, spectacular and hence more appealing to the new generation of fans. Suffice to say the success was immense and sequels to both the Frankenstein and Dracula franchise were released quickly as well as other, entirely new horror tales. For nearly twenty years, Hammer Studios set the tone of pretty much everything that concerned horror in Europe and their influence is still very noticeable to this day. The Curse of Frankenstein stars the legendary Peter Cushing as the obsessive and dangerously devoted Baron/scientist, a role he will reprise several times and perhaps THE role that made him the horror icon he's still regarded as to this day, more than 10 years past his death. The film opens with images of the degraded Baron sitting in a filthy prison cell and begins to clarify his life-story to a priest. Orphanaged at a young age, the wealthy and intellectually gifted Victor Frankenstein works, together with his mentor Dr. Paul Krempe, in the field of re-animating dead tissue and brain activity. Even though the two quickly reach a medical breakthrough, Frankenstein wants to take his experiments to a higher level and creates entirely new life by composing body parts of deceased persons. Since not every part of his ideal creation is available easy (like, for example, an intelligent brain), Frankenstein turns to murder. When Victor Frankenstein commits his first murder, exclusively to foresee his creation with the intelligent brain of a professor, everything changes. He descends into madness without really realizing it and he's no longer able to see the difference between science and insanity. Driven by blind obsession, Victor ruins the friendship between him and Paul and he totally neglects his loving fiancée Elizabeth. In a desperate attempt to stop his former friend, Paul damages the brain but still Victor is destined to continue his experiments. The man Frankenstein eventually brings to life is an aggressive monster that looks hideous and doesn't even hesitate to attack his creator. One day, the monster escapes and assaults an elderly blind man, forcing Paul and Victor to destroy the ungodly creature forever....or so Paul thinks. When he returns to Frankenstein's castle several weeks later to attend Victor's wedding to Elizabeth, the Baron proudly informs him that the monster got resurrected yet again and now it even obeys simple commands. Nonetheless, the murderous creation escapes again and this time the consequences won't be dismissed so easily... The priest from the intro can't bring Victor any salvation and the movie ends with the once prominent heir of the Frankenstein fortune walking towards the guillotine... I initially stated that this film isn't really Hammer's finest film. Some of their later horrors (notably The Devil Rides Out, Quatermass and the Pit and also some of the sequels to this very film) look more appealing and more properly elaborated. The budget for Curse of Frankenstein, however, was low and this resulted in occasionally tacky special effects and a lack of diversity in settings. The movie is largely filmed on one location  the Baron's laboratory  simply because there was no money for other decors. The limited budget is also clearly noticeable by the absence of a vast Gothic atmosphere and a modest use of color-shades (there were Hammer is specifically knows for their heavy use of colors). Even though not a very spectacular horror film, The Curse of Frankenstein remains a milestone in the genre, with some great suspense and a truly powerful acting performance by Peter Cushing. This film is legendary for yet another entirely different reason, as it also meant the first of many horror collaborations between Cushing and Christopher Lee! Nineteen, to be exact, including masterful genre highlights like The Creeping Flesh, Horror Express and The House that Dripped Blood. Lee's share in this production is very brief (the creature Frankenstein gives life to) but oh-so-memorable, and his make-up effects still look nightmarish nearly half a century later. It's perhaps not the greatest horror movie ever made but real fans of the genre will have to acknowledge that Curse of Frankenstein is a genuine classic that set a lot of later standards.</td><td>rw1134305</td><td>Cushing creates lifeHammer re-creates the monster-movie!</td><td>Coventry</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>12 Monkeys (1995)</td><td>9</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>James Cole(Bruce Willis) lives in an apocalyptic future where disease has taken over the earth and only a very small percentage has survived by living underground.

New Horror tried to find, to create, a new idea of terror closer to the \"human body\", an immanent and \"rational\" idea of terror.In this way George A. Romero's movies, with their political suggestions, are the more revolutionary in their genre and, well, i think that Marins' movies too, in their particular, experimental way, follow and reinvent the horror cinema modern notion born in 60's. In the beginning of this amazing picture Ze Do Caixao, presenting his three stories, says: \"You cannot understand the terror because you are the terror!\".In this statement resides the whole picture: especially the third story, the best one, shows that what scared us are the body's extremes, the \"instincts\" as Ze says.This argument by Marins\\Do Caixao creates a modern notion of horror: filming this Marins checks new extreme forms of the bodies, a new way to be, a way that can be easily confused with sadism or with pure bizarre gory cinematographic entertainment.But Marin's way is really more radical than this kind of simple stuffs.It's an experimental way! Even if all the three stories are led by the same argument - the new notion of terror related by the new new notion of body - only the third one is successful to get the argument in a great complete visual way.Other two stories, especially the first one, are obvious and don't suggest anything new about searching a suitable image for the matter. Anyway, a good, funny too, modern and experimental horror picture.

I mean let's face it people, this movie is basically about nothing! The story doesn't seem to go anywhere as the movie progresses and in the ending the movie becomes more and more ridicules and implausible. The movie is truly lacking in scary moments also because the timing is just plain bad. Not once did this movie become scary or even tense.Still you have to give the movie credit for a few things. The actors are really superb. But why on Earth is the main character played by Lili Taylor, when you have a cast with Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson and even Bruce Dern? Lili Taylor is the least known actress of the cast but yet she plays the main part. Yes, I know she was kind of 'hot' in the '90's but noway near as 'hot' as Zeta-Jones at the time, who had just done \"The Mask of Zorro\" or Liam Neeson who just before this had done \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\" and \"Rob Roy\", \"Michael Collins\" and \"Schindler's List\" a few years before. Bruce Dern and also Virginia Madsen are terribly underused in this movie, I wouldn't describe their roles as anything more than just a cameo appearance.Also something that this movie deserves credit for is the look of it. Director Jan de Bont had always been inspired by Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\", also back in his days as director of cinematography. This is really notable especially in this movie. There is nothing wrong with the fine cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub, who used to be the director of cinematography of many Roland Emmerich movies and Caleb Deschanel who later dropped out due to creative differences. That's mildly put, Jan de Bont basically is a pain to work with for cinematographers because de Bont used to be a cinematographer himself for years. Cinematographer Don Burgess already also had left the set after 'differences' with de Bont during the filming of \"Twister\". The editing however is bad, I can't believe that it was Michael Kahn who worked on this movie!Persons who will be fairly entertained by this movie are the fans of special effects. There are some nicely made effects, which however are not scary and suitable for an horror movie of this type.It's not a completely unwatchable movie but still a weak and un-scary movie that most certainly is not recommendable.

It is also one of the most sadistic. George Payne, who previously starred in gay porn films, grants us a psychotic performance of an innocent man who is coming to terms that he is the Marquis De Sade. During the night, he suffers from powerful nightmares where he proceeds to torture his wife; however, his wife in his nightmares appears to be that of Justine, one of the famous characters from the real Marquis De Sade books. George soon visits a shrink in an attempt to solve his problems. Instead of unravelling his problems and thus living a happy life with his newly wed wife, his problems continue to escalate until one of the characters die towards the end in a brilliantly well-done twist that came as a shock.!!Spoilers!! Kneel Before contains many scenes of shocking perversion that will shock some people. In fact, there's bound to be something here that will shock all viewers. The genital torture imposed on Annie Sprinkle by the Marquis De Sade is hard to watch. Scenes of penis abuse will make any man watching quiver. The forced urine drinking scene forced Annie Sprinkle to quit porn for awhile. The only other scene that made her reconsider her career was the urination and abuse scene in The Devil Inside Her (1976). The sex scenes all take place in a darkened dungeon which adds to the unpleasant atmosphere already provided. Ron Jeremy takes part in the orgy, well before his days of success in mainstream adult films.

Willi born into the cream of Vienna society rose in the rank of the elite Royal Imperial Guard to the point where he became a member of it's officer corps. Always having friends and relatives in high places to clean up after him after he royally screwed things up Willi has no idea of what being responsible was. With Willi's uncle Gen. Von Hertz, C. Aubrey Smith, in charge of the military base that he's stationed at he knew that whatever boners he pulled good old Uncle Hertz would take care of them. One thing Willi didn't expect to happen was to fall in love with someone else, besides himself,and accept the responsibility that goes alone with that.At a party with his officer friends at the Vienna night-spot \"Madam Saguss\" Willi spots this sweet and lovely young lady Laura Taub, Helen Chandler,who's a music teacher. Later Willi sees Laura going upstairs to a room with big spender and notorious whore-mister Herr Schnabel,Jean Hersholt. Suspecting that Schnabel was up to no good Willi goes to see if everything is all right only to hear Laura screaming inside the hotel-room as she fights off Schnabel from trying to force himself on her. Willi puts an end to Herr Schnabel's advances by punching him out. Taking the grateful Laura, who at first didn't trust him, on a night on the town Willi spends the next morning at her apartment having breakfast. After promising to see her again and kissing her good-by Willi innocently leaves a 100 Krone bank note on her dinning room table. Helen ,who fell in love with Willi, by seeing the note after Willi left now feels insulted by what he did in treating her as if she were just a one night stand to him or even worse. With Helen letting Willi have it when he came to see her the next day, about what he did to her, left him both hurt and humiliated since he also fell in love with Helen. Willi's action, by leaving the money, was nothing more that a show of appreciation not a fee for her spending the night with him, which didn't include anything more serious then two or three harmless smooches and getting her a bit tipsy on a couple of glasses of French wine. Helen goes over the deep end by going back to the sleazy Herr Schnabel and becoming the kind of person that she thinks that Willi thought that she was with her drinking gambling and whoring around. Guilt-ridden by what he did to Helen in turning her into a party animal-type, from the sweet and innocent girl that she was, Willi tries to win her back from Schnabel. Challenging to go head to head with Schnabel in a no holds-bar game of Baccarat Willi feels that would win Helen back to him. In the big showdown Schnabel totally wipes out Willi leaving him 14,000 krone's in debt and a broken and destroyed young man. Being too proud to ask his uncle Gen. Von Hertz for the money and facing disgrace as a member of the Royal Imperial Guard Willi has only one option left open to him: a bullet to the head from his own service revolver. Decent ending that doesn't at all cop-out like you would have thought that it would with Willi redeeming himself and getting back, as well as saving her from a life of sin, the women that he loved Helen. Coming to grips with the real world Willi threw away his playboy lifestyle that he lived all his adult life. Like Willi said when he came to see Helen at the end of the film when asked, by the parents of a young boy that Helen was teaching to play the piano, why he didn't have his army uniform on he answered this way: Were both going to a masquerade and I'm going as a human being.</td><td>rw1134324</td><td>You measure love with a thermometer not with a calender</td><td>sol1218</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(5, 9)</td><td>Robots (2005)</td><td>4</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>If you love the ever burgeoning list of computer animated flicks, it's worth seeing \"Robots\" just for the superb visual design. In fact, that's the only reason to see it.This is a \"schtick\" movie, like the classic Warner Brothers cartoons of the 40's & 50's. I can handle that for 3 or 4 minutes, but not for the 91 minute running time of this movie. The folks at Blue Sky have failed to learn what Pixar has always known: Story. Story. Story.\"Robots\" treats us to a pastiche of set pieces stuck together by a plot that is so clichéd it's virtually impossible to put a spoiler in here because you've already seen it all before: Evil corporation, valiant naive hero, funny sidekick, \"you're okay just as you are\" theme. And it's really too bad because \"Robots\" is a visual treat. The gleaming surfaces and rounded designs remind me nostalgically of my parents 1955 Chevy Bel Air. But even there it doesn't always make sense. Whether something is a robot or not depends not on the story, but on whether they can get a joke out of it.See it for the visuals. Skip it for the story.

This is certainly a prettier and more polished film, with better production values, occasionally brilliant camera-work, and better acting (despite having the same principal cast). The same elements of the original are mostly intact - a psychotic serial killing family, vaguely satanic sadism, comedy, torture and a lot of blood. What's missing are the ambiguities, the darkness and the outright psychosis which appear in \"House\". And to compensate the audience for the loss of some of the elements which made \"House\" a good film, Zombie throws in sex - the most over-used plot device in cinematic history. Of course, its not just sex, but sexual violence mixed with torture, blood and nightmares.In other words, where 'house' was a dark, campy, creepy murder flick, \"Rejects\" is a light-drenched, raw, fairly (but not entirely) serious murder flick. No problems with the script, the acting, the concept, or even the plot - but, some definite problems with the entertainment value of the film. This just isn't terribly original and drops the idiosyncrasy of \"House\" for a typical Hollywood approach. Rejects starts out with a police raid on the house of a thousand corpses. Most of the family escape through a tunnel in their basement (why the police were unable to find this tunnel is a mystery). The police nab the mother, who plays up the satanic expectations of the police interrogating her and infuriates the sheriff (well played by William Forsythe) into an obsessive, vengeful state (his brother had been murdered by the family years ago). The Fireflies leave a trail of terror and murder in their wake and Forsythe follows it, until he is able to set his trap. I won't go any further with the plot outline because I do not want to write a spoiler, but I do want to elaborate on Forsythe's intense performance. His rage and self-righteous wrath blur the boundaries between cops and criminals quite effectively as the story progresses. If you want to know what I mean, you'll have to see the film.The Firefly family, through most of the film, consist of Otis a lank tall man with long stringy gray hair, Captain Spaulding, an intimidating evil and merciless clown and Baby, Spaulding's daughter, a cute blond particularly fond of torturing her male victims. The characters are more or less consistent with their portrayals in \"House\", but I have to admit, I think Shari Moon Zombie's Baby was very inconsistent from film to film. In \"House\" she is completely and utterly insane and fearless - using her shrill psychotic laughter especially well. In 'Rejects', she screams a lot, does a lot of running-away, and is actually fairly rational compared with her sadistic, torture-loving murderous kin.Finally, I don't think you can really 'get' this film if you haven't seen 'House'. So if you have any reason to want to see it, see \"House\" first. Some of the behavior of the characters will make little sense to you without their back-story.Bottom line: Weakly recommended for horror fans.</td><td>rw1134326</td><td>Worth Seeing, But Check Out \"House...\" First</td><td>mstomaso</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 3)</td><td>Hustle & Flow (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>I really thought this movie was excellent, if not one of the best I've seen this year. Great story, very inspirational to the \"little guy with a big dream\". I've been a fan of Terrance Howard for years and am very happy to see him finally get the spotlight he should have had a long time ago. Why he hasn't is beyond me. He's got the talent in bucketfuls and has a great yet unique look. Before I knew his name, I used to call him the \"really good black guy with the green eyes\" that was in so many films and the occasional music video. Taryn Manning also really helped make this movie for me as the lovable hooker with a sweet heart. One thing I appreciated - that usually drives me nuts - is that you really got to know and CARE about all the characters. You know how they met, why, what their dreams were and you cared to see them achieve it. The entire audience was laughing, gasping or sucking in their breaths during the film and it's just a shame I had to drive so far to see it. It's not playing in any of the theaters around my house...but I'm OK to get in the car for something good. Did it for Layer Cake, too. Anyway, no spoilers here...just a great film (Singleton can't make anything bad) that was a real inspiration.

I've read reviews where folks think that this movie is not as good as the other Studio Ghibli movies (we have almost all of them) and so we were wary. Frankly, this turned out to be such a great date movie! It was truly a love story, and I believe that this was the first of Studio Ghibli's true love stories. At least it seems to be the only one of it's kind in English.The best part of this movie happens when Howl introduces Sophie to a wildflower swept field, which is Howl's own personal space, and is a memory from his childhood. At that point, my husband and I were completely immersed in the world that Ghibli once again wonderfully and almost magically created. Believe me, when you reach that point in the movie, you will be \"spirited away.\" Pun intended. We will purchase this movie when it is released on DVD, and cannot wait to watch this movie again and again.

Even though I am a huge fan of pop music, there is a very soft spot on my heart for heavy metal and rock -n- roll music.As most of you know, if you have viewed my comments, I am a huge horror movie fan. I enjoyed House of 1000 Courpses; it had a Texas Chainsaw massacre feel and went back to the classic horror movie clique's that most horror fans truly enjoy. \"The Devil's Rejects\" is by far more violent and scary. Like the commercial said \"They kill without reason\". That's right! The family's back and they're more homicidal than ever! House of 1000 Courpses was a little edited you can tell by Rob's standards, I think he had more freedom with this movie. It is incredibly violent and in no way should be shown to children. I couldn't believe actually that it was only rated R. But I did for some sick reason enjoy it. I'm not sure why, maybe because I was just in a good mood for a gory flick.In this film, Baby and Otis completely torture this family, and I MEAN torture. Sexually, violently, mentally, your body just aches for what happens to them. But I'm not giving spoilers away. Captain Spawlding is back and he's a lot meaner than the first film. They finish off over dozen victims with a great ending playing a terrific song by the late great Lenord Skynord, \"Free Bird\". \"And this bird you cannot change\".

The pictures in the film and the factory were spectacular and mesmerizing. Without even paying attention to the story line it was clear this was a Tim Burton film, truly fantastic. But Like watching a model trying to ponder physics, the beauty is only skin deep. Where was the heart in this movie? The acting, the dialog, the people all fell short of human behavior. Small example: A child spoiled all her life only taunts her father with the resounding demand: \"I want it Daddy.\" Where's the yelling, the screams, has no one EVER SEEN a tantrum?? Additional Example: The parents seemed hardly upset with their children's misfortune. As a parent would you not run out and help your daughter if she were attacked by ANYTHING much less squirrels?!The Ompa Loompa problem: I loved them actually.

Before I say anything else, I'll tell you I'm a critical movie watcher. I'm European, prefer European movies as they have far more depth and diversity and I have little respect for the rubbish shoveled out of Hollywood. But I still keep an eye on it. Even among the trash you can find things worth keeping, and this movie definitely qualifies.The story is sobering, at least at first. It doesn't hold it's punches when the human condition (at least in L.A.) is described, and it shows us racism is rampant everywhere. Yes, even in the USA. The quality of this movie lies is the complexity of the emotion that is shown - events and characters are not black and white, if you pardon the pun. Characters are far more rounded that we are used to seeing in Hollywood movies. Still, Crash doesn't manage to keep it's strong points going for the entire duration of the movie. Sentimentalism creeps in, some events you can see from a mile away and the obligatory 'happy' ending cannot be avoided (I don't think you'd consider it a spoiler if I tell you most characters in the movie have received a lesson in life by the end). But what we see in between opening and closing credits is strong enough to make not want to dwell on that too much - it's also strong enough for me not to be naive and think the lessons learned will stick, not with most of them anyway.All in all, it's a rare thing to see a movie of this quality, with this cast, come out of the Hollywood studio's.

There are some things that I was disappointed with. As an example, I was disappointed with the ending, even though I didn't see it coming. It could have been so much more. However, Ashley Judd's character as Jessica Sheppard makes up for that and the movie's plot and series of events perfectly tie into the overall quality of the movie. I am a big fan of Ashley Judd as it is. I have seen her in Someone Like You, Twisted, Kiss The Girls, High Crimes, and Double Jeopardy, and I loved every single one of them. I don't agree with the reviews that state that Ashley Judd's reputation of starring in movies with this genre is too consistent and therefore boring. I like Ashley in Crime movies. It works for her.This film starts as Jessica Sheppard (Judd) successfully arrests a convict who has a series of murders on his plate. Soon enough vicious and raging murders begin that contain evidence that points to Jessica from all directions. It is very convincing too. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that up until you find out whether or not she is the killer, you will be convinced that she is, and that effect doesn't spoil the surprise either, because there are still reasons for you to doubt it.This is an awesome thriller that deserves much better reviews than it has been receiving.

I was impressed with her performance in Mr Blandings Build His Dream House where she does more than hold her own in her all too short appearances with stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. And I was not disappointed. She really is the solid center of this movie and its true star. She is like some sort of early method actress with a terrific screen presence, and her stile of acting differs remarkably from the more affected ones of her acting colleagues in this movie who come through as real airheads (or, shall we say designer products?) in their imitation of life.Basically I think this is less a movie about race but about Delilah's values  and in this aspect it is an entirely different movie than the remake of 1957. Although beset by a hard and difficult life, Delilah is a balanced person of principle. And she has knowledge, on philosophical as well as practical ways. She accepts her place in society (that is a personal choice, mind you) and aims to make the best out of it. The world of Big Dreams is not hers. Her meeting another women with the daring and the tenaciousness of a dye hard capitalist is, seen in that context, a sort of an accident. This other woman discovers and exploits Delilah's knowledge, first on a small then on a very large scale. Delilah's values lead to commercial success, Delilah's portrait becomes literally a brand (incidentally, a beautiful Art Deco design, not unlike Uncle Ben's). She takes success gracefully, although she does not really care about it. And she knows, there will always be things money can't buy and they most probably will determine your personal happiness. The daughters of the two single mothers seem to symbolize the mean truth, that there are issues that are simply beyond a mother's will and have to be left to godly powers. Delilah's daughter just wants to be an airhead too (that is a personal choice, mind you). She is most happy blending in with the anonymous general crowd of our modern times selling cigars in a store (Fredi Washington's best scene). There's nothing her mother can do about it.MINOR SPOILER AHEAD At the end of the movie, Delilah dies, probably of a broken heart. The world of airheads was too much for that archaic type of good, motherly woman. She leaves a vacuum behind, and people wistfully watch her stylized portrait eternally turning over flickering electric pancakes on the huge billboard on a rooftop.

On the other hand \"You already have everything in yourself, you don't need a wizard\" is useful. Also, a confident woman as the protagonist in a movie, which is not a \"love/relationship-movie\", is still a rather rare sight nowadays. But, all in all the characters are way too simple for my taste. While they work well for delivering the primary messages of the movie, there are nearly no hidden, underlying, secondary themes or messages to think about, unless you count quotes such as \"But sometimes people without brains talk a lot! - Yes I guess that is true...\"(When Dorothy meets the scarecrow) . Also, what conclusion is a child supposed to make when it is told good-looking=good, ugly=evil... And, there were more questionable plot elements: - Why put up an hour glass, when it has no meaning at all? - Why are the antagonists so stupid and laugh all the time? - It is extremely unimaginative story wise that Dorothy kills the \"bad guy\" with luck! And, most importantly: Why does the evil witch need to be killed at all? A peaceful solution would have been way more appropriate. I think this is really sending a wrong message to kids, especially considering the current world situation....Don't get me wrong, I can see that this was a great movie in its time, but I can understand it very well if younger people do not find it interesting, and in my opinion there really are better movies with similar messages out there, for example \"Spirited Away\".</td><td>rw1134338</td><td>Not quite up to date in its message but still worth watching</td><td>Lu-Tze</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(20, 33)</td><td>Straight Into Darkness (2004)</td><td>10</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>This is an excellent film.

Drogan wants Halsten to kill his cat...because he believes that the cat had killed his two sisters and his butler. Halsten soon realizes that this cat is hard to kill. Easily the darkest of the three stories and also the most predictable.Wraparound: Elizibeth is now ready to eat...but it's still 30 minutes until the oven is pre-heated. Timmy tells her one last story.Story 3: Lovers Vow. A struggling artist(Remar) gets a call and goes to a bar. His lawyer(Robert Klein) is there and tells him that he quits. Remar gets drunk and the bartender is going to give him a ride home. When they get out there, a strange creature cuts, then knocks the bartender's head off. Remar swears that if it doesn't kill him, he'll never tell anyone. After clawing him, the creature leaves. He runs to get a cab, but instead runs into a woman(Rae Dawn Chong). He tells her to stay with him, because it's dangerous out. They have sex and soon get married and have two kids. His art career also started to succeed, so his lawyer came back. Finally...it tears him up inside to have shared everything with his wife except for what he saw...so he tells her. Another surprise ending.....probably the best of the three.Wraparound: (SPOILER) Timmy is ready to tell her more stories, but she's ready to eat. He then starts telling his story of how he got here and Elizabeth spouts,\"You don't need to tell me this one. We both know how it ends.\" Timmy tells what he's going to do. He pulls marbles out of his pocket and she trips on them and falls on the gutters behind her and trys to pull them out.

Major Davis Bay, Gary Cole,decided one morning to just walk away from in all and start a new life as a civilian. David first got this idea when he met at a Halloween party sweet and adoring Alyson, Karen Sillas. Keeping his background secret from her by telling Alyson that he's in a top secret military outfit was the perfect cover for him. Back at Jackson AFB outside of Austin Tex. David starts to review his life's options with Cindy and the USAF and decides to change his identity by running away from it. David then calls Alyson, who only met him once, and makes a date with her. Before you know it David, now using the name Haywood,is engaged to be married to her.Faking his death in a bicycle accident Dave purposely leave his wife and kids out in the cold and deserts his military obligation to his country.It didn't take long for Dave to find out that civilian life just doesn't appeal to him. It's now too late for Dave to go back to his first wife Cindy and his two boys with him facing the brig and a military court-martial if he comes back to the USAF. Dave takes up the only job that he could do to support him and Alyson and their infant son Chris: using his skills he learned in the Red Berets to rob banks.Based on a true story \"Lies He Told\" has Dave Bay/Haywood living three, not two, different lives. One of a hard working family man one as a ruthless bank robber and yet another one as a dead and highly decorated, by the President of the US and Prime Misnister Of GB, All-American hero. Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. David Bay&husband David Haywood. Davids actions are, even though unforgivable, understandable in the case of his depression over his marriage to Cindy. The pressure of her nagging him got to the point where he just wanted to get lost and away from her and the kids. But he should have sought professional counseling from the US Air Force, which he would have been gladly provided with, instead of choosing the easy way out. Which in the end lead him straight into Levenworth Ferderal Prison. It may have been that the overly macho Dave thought it would have been a bad mark on his career, as well as his ego, to get help for his problems.Karen Sillas as Alyson is the glue that keeps the film together with her at first going along with her new husbands explanation of his frequent disappearances, some for as much as two weeks, as him doing covert action in keeping the country safe from domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reasons for his long absences were the result of him casing out planing and robbing banks. Which was the only way he knew how to earn a living given from what he learned, in subversive actions, all those years in the elite Red Berets.Alyson tracking down Dave's mom Carolyn Bay(Linda Goranson), who he told her was dead since he was a small boy, in Portland she finds out the truth about the double, or triple, life that he's been leading since he married her. This lead to Alyson finding out about his marriage to Linda and the two sons that he had with her as well as his faked death, and now AWOL, from the USAF. Being that it's a true story the ending was anything that you would have guessed it to be in a standard Hollywood, or made for TV, movie. That's what makes the film \"Lies he Told, a lot better then what you would have expected it to be.</td><td>rw1134342</td><td>Tell Chris his dad was a hero once</td><td>sol-kay</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(5, 10)</td><td>The Devil's Rejects (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>This is what i have to say about Devil's Rejects..I rooted against the good guys.

The canceling of Firefly was as big a mistake as canceling Family Guy. Firefly is probably the most original and refreshing Sci-Fi to hit the tube in a long while. It combines, the noiseless tranquility of space with the best collected characters from a Sergio Leone western and mixes them in a cake pan of brilliant dialogue and smart stories. I think most people who watch the show can enjoy and relate to the simplicity of these characters and their mission. All they want to do is work, they want their next job and they want it to go off without any problems. Simple and sweet (of course it wouldn't be good TV if everything went smooth). I love Star Trek very much, but Voyager and Enterprise made me seek out new life and civilization; and that's when I stumbled on this space opera. I am sad to say I've never seen the original broadcasts, but from discussing sci-fi with a lot of common thinking geeks, like myself, many of them mentioned Firefly and it made me find the series on DVD. Firefly is a highly entertaining and educated show, what was nice is that they don't try and explain too much technology or why things are the way they are. Much like the original Star Trek series, the character chemistry is high and the stories are simple, to the point and fun--oh and the fact that the characters all swear in Mandarin is a very nice touch by creator Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel)</td><td>rw1134346</td><td>I hope Firely comes back to TV</td><td>mjdr007</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 4)</td><td>Kicking & Screaming (2005)</td><td>1</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Will Ferrell used to be one of my favourite actors.

I am a massive Will Ferrell fan, I even liked One Night at the Roxbury, but in this movie Will has no comedic support and fails to provide any humour on his own. This calls into question his ability to judge a script.

When there is transition from Spanish to Portuguese occupation however, the natives are legally treated as slaves and their status as Christians and indeed as human beings is effectively revoked. Robert De Niro plays a ruthless slave trader who becomes a priest after he is overcome by the guilt of his sins. Much of the film simultaneously documents his transition to the faith and these scenes are some of the most powerful in the film. Jeremy Irons plays Father Gabriel, head of the Spanish Jesuit order who is able to help both De Niro and the native Indians. The film also features the very young looking Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn. The Mission received an Oscar for Cinematography and with stunning visuals and a breathtaking display of the jungle it is not hard to see why. Ennio Morricone's score also received an Oscar nomination and various other awards (e.g. Golden Globe and BAFTA). Morricone's score will undoubtedly stand the test of time as one of the most powerful soundtracks to grace the big screen. It is powerful, emotive and poetic and almost warrants viewing the movie alone. Fans of movie soundtracks will not be disappointed. Overall performances are decent with De Niro again stealing the show. The Mission is a good example of De Niro delivering a powerful performance without having to make too much of a song and dance visually. He also illustrates the contrast between an angry and menacing individual in the early part of the movie to one that is more at peace with others in the latter part of the movie suggesting that anyone can achieve redemption. The Mission is quite an engrossing movie that is possibly drawn out for a little too long. The visual and audio feast is enough to warrant a viewing but it somehow feels like it lacks the hall marks of a true classic. Given the subject matter is not the most optimistic or uplifting film but this is necessary to give the film any sense of realism about human history and indeed what is happening today.</td><td>rw1134348</td><td>An Engrossing Visual Adventure</td><td>arahman</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>DeGenere (2003)</td><td>7</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>This movie is very different from many others own-productions all around; actors and actress are real people taken in the hood of friendship and their roles are conformed to the thematics.

Two spies (played by Harry Semels and Phyllis Barry) go along with the ruse, even though they know that the Stooges are impostors. It only gets worse from there, because once the Stooges knock out the spies, they prove that they cannot control a submarine properly.There aren't many highlights in this short, but I will state a couple. Curly reprises the spring-on-the-trousers gag that he had done originally in \"Hoi Polloi\" (1935) and that he will do again later in \"An Ache in Every Stake\" (1941). (This gag would be redone even later with Shemp Howard and Curly-Joe DeRita as the third Stooges.) And at the end, when Curly accidentally blows up the submarine and the Stooges get killed, they are seen as angels flying in the heavens. Curly looks back and spots the winged Admiral Taylor (James C. Morton), whom he posed as, chasing them. Curly then warns Moe and Larry, \"Hey, step on it! Look who's comin'!\" Some may find it disturbing that the Stooges get killed, and \"Three Little Sew and Sews\" is not the only film in which that happens.

Revenge of the Sith, is, by far, the strongest of the three prequel films Lucas began releasing in 1999.Revenge of the Sith still exhibits many of the weaknesses of his previous two entries: questionable dialog, some occasionally silly scenes and performances that don't always show the actors in their best light. But this is all trivial compared to the good aspects of Revenge of the Sith: engaging action sequences, outstanding visual effects and the most involving dramatic moments featured in a Star Wars film.As the film opens, the Galactic Republic is still in the throes of war with separatists that began at the conclusion of the previous film. We are treated to an breathtaking extended action sequence that features Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) attempting to rescue the Galactic Republic's Chancellor, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), from the clutches of Sith Lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and the robot army leader, General Grevious (voiced by Matthew Woods). After the success of the mission, Anakin is reunited with his secret wife, Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), who reveals she is pregnant with his child. Plagued by dreams of Padme's death during childbirth, Anakin finds himself more and more susceptible Palpatine's insinuations of learning the power available to one from the Dark Side of the Force. When a critical juncture is reached during the war, the Jedi, not trusting Palpatine's motives, decide to seize the Republic from him, with dire results. Palpatine then convinces Anakin to become his apprentice, with the reward being learning a method to save Padme from death, and so he takes the name Darth Vader. Palpatine then sends him on a mission to wipe out the remaining Jedi and bring the war to a close, while Palpatine manipulates the Galactic Senate into becoming the Galactic Empire under his rule.Most of the details of the plot are familiar to anyone who is fan of the original trilogy, so the outcome of the events of this film are hardly a surprise. However, George Lucas imbues the film with a stronger element of drama than any previous entry in the series. There is some powerful, emotional material on display here, intertwining the fates of various characters in a complex web of deceit and betrayal. Especially moving is the plight of Anakin Skywalker. His character is so desperate to keep everyone that he loves that he actually causes the very things he fears by holding on too tight and making questionable choices. More than any character in the Star Wars saga, Anakin is a decidedly tragic figure, and you cannot help but feel a strong sense of pathos for him as the film progresses.Lucas also delves into the nature of a totalitarian regime and how it can spring up, rather unforeseeable, from a strong and virile democracy. For the first time in the Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith also introduces some shades of grey into the conflict between good and evil, where previously everything had been depicted in black and white. The Jedi are presented almost borderline arrogant, sure of their passionless approach to the universe, while the Sith seem to embrace the affections of others. That does not necessarily change the conflict, the Sith are still evil, the Jedi good, but how Anakin perceives the situation is what gives the new nuances some strength.Of course, a Star Wars film wouldn't be a Star Wars film without some serious eye-candy, and Revenge of the Sith delivers in spades. The elaborate opening space battle is impressive, the screen filled to bursting with visual information. There are several digital characters in the film, the most interesting being General Grevious. He is a mix of machine and living being, and he is no less a character than any flesh and blood actor featured in the film. Yoda returns to the digital fold again after first being rendered with ones and zeroes for Episode II, and again he holds up just as well as the puppet of old.We are also treated to several elaborate action set-pieces, the strongest being the climactic lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan. The battle unfolds on the surface of a molten lava planet named Mustafar, and setting is appropriate for Anakin's decent into his own personal hell. The battle on Mustafar is intercut with a similar duel between Yoda and Palpatine in the Galactic Senate chamber, and both hold our attention without fail.If Episode III has a weakness, it's the acting and dialogue. While most of the performers do a serviceable job, at times they falter, struggling with clunky dialogue. That being said, Episode III does feature at least one standout performance, that of Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. Delivering what I think is strongest performance to date in any Star Wars film, McDiarmid shines as Palpatine moves his plans from the background to the forefront. Ewan McGregor brings some levity to the proceedings with his jovial performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but is serious when necessary. Hayden Christensen brings his work up a notch from Episode II with the darker, more serious Anakin. While he is saddled with some of the worst dialogue, he still manages it well.And so, after better than 20 years, the book is finally (theoretically) closed on Star Wars. I, for one, was glad to be there for the ride, and happy to see it go out on a strong note.

When a comedic movie falls into the same category, it is almost impossible to make sport of it  because any frivolity in the review may be misconstrued as comedic quality that the MOVIE possesses. So let me clarify from the outset: This \"comedy\" is not to be laughed at.Who would have thought that Mel Brooks  the genius writer/director behind Blazing Saddles, History Of The World and Young Frankenstein (a successful comedy movie wholly in the vein of this failed one  pun intended)  would be prone to helming a comedy as pitifully appalling as \"Dracula: Dead And Loving It\"? One imagines that Brooks' comic radar is so finely-attuned that he would have seen through the financial and corporate layers of this film's drudgery and simply either abandoned it and cut his losses when he saw that it was not working, or salvaged the potential high points and let the cutting room floor eat the rest.He did neither, which reveals that something is terribly askew in the Brooks universe. No longer is it \"good to be the king\" - Mel Brooks is merely an old man these days, his tastes no longer running congruent with his audience's; his comedy no longer as energetic or as biting as the wit of his youth (which, relatively speaking, was his late-40s anyway).The Brooks gag formulas are definitely still there, but seem lazily inserted as dependable fallback material, rather than inspired stylistic substance. Jokes which I can imagine my 15-year-old self repeating ad nauseam in the schoolyard, now fall flat and wearisome on inured sensibilities.Not only does the film suffer from rehashed and lazy gags, Brooks' direction lacks coherence and is oft-times merely cursory; there are wide shots, reverses and close-ups which serve no purpose, camera blandly flitting from one unnecessary shot to the next, not merely misdirecting our eye, but searching for subject matter to fill the frame judiciously. Many shots seem to be second-unit throwaway footage. Instead of easing back and letting the film's levity wash over me, as should have been the case, all these logistical details kept bugging my senses, detracting from the already-sparse humor.During the cast-and-crew screening for this film, one has to wonder whether there were any genuine laughs or whether the aura of the director's past glories tainted the crew into believing that they had a good comedy on their hands, thereby eliciting perfunctory giggles out of respect for their elders.In this film's adherence to the original Dracula story and noticeable neglect of comedic opportunities, not only did it fail as a good comedy, it becomes barely convincing as an A-List movie. Brooks did not need to re-make \"Dracula\". Yet this seems to be all he did  in a manner inferior to that of droves of dramatic film-makers before him. Mel's strong suit is COMEDY. So why were we subjected to a film about the infamous psychotic blood-drinker, so loosely sprinkled with jokes that they seem incongruous within the context of the morbid tale? Where you would expect punchlines, there are scene-fades; where you would expect a gag, there is exposition of the Dracula legend; where you would expect laugh-out-loud-slapstick, there are strained attempts at re-capturing youthful insouciance from laurels past. And the dance sequence between Dracula and Mina was needless padding. (Makes you wonder what DID make the cutting room floor.) The actors vacillate between parodying Victorian characters and actually *playing* them. Harvey Korman's Dr. Seward can almost be an actual over-actor from one of the REAL Dracula movies, whilst Steven Weber's Jonathan Harker frequently comes across as an exaggerated English nobleman from a Christopher Lee film. Peter MacNichol, though, makes the perfect Renfield  for ANY Dracula film, serious or spoof - and is the only actor who truly nails his role in this blunt-toothed parody. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony are just too damn hot to be funny: all the self-deprecating melodrama in the world is not gonna help, chickie-babes - LOOK AT THOSE RACKS! On paper, Leslie Neilsen's Dracula seemed like a hilarious coup, as did Mel Brooks' Dr. van Helsing, but both seemed to be laboring under the specter of their own reputations as funnymen. Neilsen playing STRAIGHT and being oblivious to his own humor is how he works best, but here he actively went for laughs, which means that even Brooks, as director, did not discern Neilsen's forte - or *did* discern it and chose to make Neilsen play against type anyway  either way, an erroneous decision. And Brooks' van Helsing seemed too self-aware of every mispronunciation he made - for the sake of schoolyard quotes - to be regarded as genuinely hilarious.If Mel Brooks has grown so blind that he cannot see that the comedy boat has left him onshore; if he has become so oblivious to discernment that he actually thinks this film is noteworthy enough to be considered a vital \"comedy\", the movie's subtitle may well be applied to HIM  \"Dead  And Loving It\".(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.thedunmore.com/POFFY-MovieReviews.html)</td><td>rw1134355</td><td>Frightfully Fangless</td><td>dunmore_ego</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(7, 8)</td><td>La notte dell'alta marea (1977)</td><td>null</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>When I saw Twilight of Love (as it was called) on the fantastic Canadian Drive-In Classics my interest was sparked because it had Pam Grier in it. Never hearing of this movie before I set my PVR to watch it later but I check here on IMDb to find out a little background but there was no plot description, reviews or home video release information. I found that all very strange considering the cult following that Grier has and because of that I ended up staying up and watching the entire thing. W/in the first couple of frames it became quite apparent why Twilight of Love hasn't been painstaking restored because the copy that Drive-In Classics was broadcasting @ times looked like someone had driven over it in their drive way (including missing frames); plus there are some things I'm pretty sure would now have heavy copyright on them like the cans of Coke and a hockey game @ the Montreal Forum that had advertisements for KISS hanging all over the place (you know if something has the KISS name on it Gene Simmons has to get paid).As for the plot of it all ~ Richard Butler; while looking for a fresh face to top his \"perfect ass\" advertising campaign spots the very boyish but still occasionally sexy Dyanne and tries to pursue a professional/personal May/December romance (even it is for only one night). Dyanne likes to play a lot of teasing games but Richard being an old man has little tolerance for such bs and becomes more and more irritable until he learns to play the game himself to keep from breaking down in his mid-life crisis. The entire ordeal is mostly scored w/ a melodramatic organ which sets the groan factor fairly high that when Richard (w/ about 10-15 minutes left , still not having gotten Dyanne in the sack and stranded on an island facing possible starvation and dehydration) reflects about his purist of Dyanne and he just \"didn't give a damn anymore\". That's was exactly how I felt: I just didn't give a damn anymore. The casting of Pam Grier (w/ nothing really to do but hang out on the beach in a bikini during her appearance in the 2nd half) does keep Twilight of Love from becoming a complete dog but mostly for Grier completests : if you can find it.</td><td>rw1134357</td><td>I just don't give a damn anymore</td><td>Alexander_Keith</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 4)</td><td>Silent Assassins (1988)</td><td>4</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>Silent Assassins must be seen to be believed.

The script by Will Gates (I hope that's not some sort of joke) & Lin Ada isn't going to win any prizes for originality or dramatic content but to it's credit it moves along like a rocket & is quite funny if approached in the right manner & frame of mind. Silent Assassins obviously had zero budget & the fights look a little cheap but they are violent & contain scenes of people having their hands chopped off, being disembowelled, someone is blown up & a brief decapitation with a Samurai sword, while none of this looks particularly impressive it's quite bloody. There is also a torture scene where Dr. London has spikes inserted under his finger nails, ouch! Forget about Linda Blair getting in on the action despite the artwork on the box where she is shown in black holding a large gun, she is purely to add dramatic impact (yeah right!) & some personal angst between the fights. The fights are OK at best, their reasonably choreographed & to their credit they use lots of weaponry like swords, Freddy Krueger type gloves, knives, guns, rocket launchers (that you don't have to reload) & various axes. The filmmakers managed to chuck in a couple of cheap explosions as well. There is a funny bit where Sam glues a mans mouth shut because he was following him & another one when Sam is interviewing a top Government scientist & on his office door it say 'Private No Admittance' written in blue ink on a piece of paper sellotaped to the door! Hardly a top scientist's office! On a technical level the film is rough, it looks like it was shot wherever they could get permission, the music is terrible & sounds as if it was recorded in a tin shed.

I studied \"I Spit on Your Grave' as part of a film violence course at university and was subjected to Ebert's disturbing views on rape revenge and movie violence in general. Ebert feels disgusted by this feature, he feels dirty as he leaves the theatre and is depressed by the immense feelings of guilt the images have left him with. Is this not how one should feel having witnessed a rape (fictional or not)? Would he have felt cleaner if Zarchi had fragmented Jennifer's naked body, had used atmospheric music to eroticise the rape scenes and depicted the female character as enjoying herself even just a little bit? In my opinion one should be disgusted and shocked senseless when viewing such material, and in this sense I feel Zarchi has achieved what many others could not. I think it was brave of the director to put such footage out there, even if he lets himself down with the more generic revenge sequences towards the end. Ebert talks about how he thinks that as a viewer we are subjected to the rapists' p.o.v. and goes on to say that this is a major reason he was so offended by the film. However, if Ebert knew anything about p.o.v. he would know that the audience is put into the place of Jennifer, given extreme close ups of the mens' distorted faces as they rape and mutilate her. We follow Jennifer in her journey from New York and most notably we stay with her during her recovery. The perpetrators are depicted as stereotypical and one dimensional, not to mention uneducated and unattractive. Therefore, if Ebert finds that he is relating to the rapists, rather than the intended Jennifer, I think the problem lies in the critic's psyche, not the feature.To top it off, Ebert reminiscences about the loss of the art of feature films, as displayed by the likes of slasher extrodinaire John Carpenter. The opening scene of Halloween then, shot literally through the eyes of faceless killer Michael Myers as he plunges a kitchen knife into the naked breasts of his older sister, is obviously good clean fun in the distorted mind of Roger Ebert.Don't be be put off by the hype surrounding this movie. Yes, watching these rape scenes is an ordeal that will never leave you, but a film about rape shouldn't be inoffensive. To date I have yet to see such a violent, brutal and disturbing depiction of a such a violent, brutal and disturbing crime. In my opinion, sexualized and eroticised versions of violence as seen in Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street are far more harmful and offensive.</td><td>rw1134359</td><td>A brave take on the rape-revenge tradition</td><td>lauriepaurie14</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 3)</td><td>Batman Begins (2005)</td><td>5</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>BATMAN BEGINS The title of this film proves to be an interesting choice. It encompasses in two words the full intentions of the film's developers, whose ultimate goal was to revive a potentially lucrative franchise that audiences left for dead years ago. Unfortunately, it also foreshadows an aimless, lackluster narrative that manages a few, fresh breathes during its otherwise mediocre, two-and-a-half hour journey. Ultimately, the film fails to entertain.This failure is most apparent in its attempt to bring the two worlds of its hero together. On the one hand is Bruce Wayne's world, which occupies the daylight hours of society; the other world, of course, is assigned to Batman, who occupies the night. These two identities make up the overall identity of the film's hero, who really deserves the overall name of Batman, as that character is what interests us most.The makers of this film must know this themselves: this is, after all, a Batman film, and this is what the audience expects to see. The film they made, however, does not reflect this knowledge. True, the film spends a sizable amount of its time  and budget  covering the background of everything associated with the Batman mythos, such as how he fights, what inventions he uses, and how he develops his reputation as a caped crusader. Yet through it all, the character of Batman eludes us, even when he is obviously present on-screen.Something is missing from this film, and its lack is sorely felt throughout. Perhaps it's a sense of the majestic, of the truly heroic. For so much time is spent dissecting the various inventions and techniques that Bruce Wayne  not Batman yet, because the cowl is off  plans to employ, that once we see them in action, their use, and the way it all looks, is a matter of course. It is hard to be astounded by the result, because the method has been fully explained.This almost neurotic emphasis on the realism of Batman's kit is strange, especially when one considers that the principal character was conceived of decades ago, well before any of this technology even existed. Somehow, Batman managed to chase down villains, break crime syndicates, and even save the entire globe, without the use the film's high-tech gadgetry that would feel more at home in a James Bond effort.This reliance on contemporary technology is so acute, the actual character of Batman is left ill-defined. Thus, while we can understand how he jumps from a tall building, and floats to one a few stories below, we have no idea what kind of mettle a man has to made of to even consider making that leap. Nor do we know what truly drives him to stay up every night, risking his life in the pursuit of criminals, only to leave them at the mercy of a system that will most likely free them in a short time.A few answers are offered, and these are revenge for the death of his family; a wounded sense of injustice; and some dimes-store psychology about childhood fears. Yet these are only partial answers, and hardly suffice as explanations of Batman's character. Most people experience a sense of injustice at some point in their lives; but what is it about Batman's beliefs that distinguishes him from us, to the extent that he wears a costume, and chases down some of the most dangerous people in the city? Most people understand the concept of revenge; yet what is it about how is Batman's desire for revenge is so intense that he dedicates his entire life to fighting crime? The remaining characters in the film are equally offered half-baked, and hollow. The lower goons and villains Batman encounters in the film are scared witless by the merest hint of his presence, while the major antagonists of the film muster no greater reputation than that of a bully. Once Batman appears on the scene, they lose the tough coolness they exhibited in front of secondary characters, and revert to laughing, cackling crackpots that know little of strategy, and probably couldn't reason through the theft of a single candy bar. Gotham city is only briefly referred to, and even then, our knowledge is limited to that of dark, grimy streets, and a lot of pouring rain.With few likable, genuinely heroic characters, the film offers little purchase for the viewer to grab on to during its long-winded ride. The fact that, during this ride, very little happens, only adds to the sense of ennui. The flashback scene that occupies almost a full hour passes by in a montage of scenes that could have been taken from a mediocre kung fu flick; while the rest of the movie involves a hefty amount of the aforementioned gadgetry, and an ambitious, villainous plot that is introduced in a decidedly clumsy fashion.Perhaps that is a good term to describe the film's overall mood: it is clumsy. The film attempts to be a thoughtful, genre-defining origin story, for a character that has fascinated many for over half a century. In this effort it fails, instead attaining a mediocre status that is entirely due to an earnest cast, and an inflated, Hollywood budget.Does it Entertain? In a word, no. The film is long, and the story uneventful. The narrative is uninspired, and played out by actors who work their hardest, in roles that might as well be straitjackets. The heavy-handed exposition behind every gadget is tiresome, and succeeds only in tarnishing whatever lustre the action might have brought.

They represented \"concepts\" not people and that's never funny unless used in a straight satire. If they were going for that maybe they should've removed the romantic backstory and left the film a pure farce on the rich and powerful and those who ONLY aspire to be rich and powerful.The ending was equally unsatisfying... the husband and wife make up and decide to going living the life that made them miserable because it was comfortable?

The \"action\" scenes consist of a close up shot of, who knows what, with the camera shaking relentlessly. I must give Bay credit however, because it is obvious that he basically made up the whole movie himself as he went along. His visual style is incredible, if only he would stop cutting every millisecond. The cinematography, especially of Scarlett Johannsen is unbelievable. She looks candy-colored. The contrast of the film every time she is shown is amazing, and the natural lighting is a breath of fresh air. We can see shadows on their faces!There is no chance in hell there was ever a full script for this version of the movie. It seems as if Steve Buschemi's lines were the only ones that they bothered to write down on paper and the rest they made up. The pacing of the film is atrocious. Compare this to even the mediocre film \"Minority Report.\" At least that film got the viewer into the story with a great opening sequence. The only decent thing about this film is the pro-life and nature vs. nurture messages it forces you to think about in between boring scenes. Also, the white suits shot from above remind me of sperm, and many of the clones are shown in embryo like sacks, violently being cut upon. Much like abortion. The character \"motivations\" are absolutely laughable. Michael Bay should be ashamed at the way he uses black people in this film. In the extremely unfunny first act, black women and men are used to make \"funny\" sassy sarcastic jokes. After having a black villain, played by Djimon Hundsou chase down the two leads with black helicopters, fire at them with machine guns relentlessly, and lead groups of men in the process of destroying the city of los angeles, he suddenly becomes a \"good\" guy. He turns against his employers and decides to help liberate the clones.There is a character who seems to be an overacting Canadian actor hamming it up. He seems to be comic relief, but we all sat through his scenes stone faced. There is one scene where he enters a gas chamber, and panics. Needless to say, it was the best part of the movie.

After her parents force her to have an abortion at the age of thirteen, Aviva runs away and hopes to get pregnant again. What she doesn't know is that the doctor at the clinic slipped-up, and left her sterile.Solondz has never been one to go mainstream, or make \"fun\" movies. His works, such as \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" (which \"Palindromes\" is a kinda/sorta sequel to) are uncomfortable to watch. Why? Because they are more truthful and honest then we expect a movie to be. Solondz shows real-life issues in lower and middle class American families who face the harshest realities, and he pulls no punches. This is not your typical multi-plex fare. Not at all.\"Palindromes\" is about Aviva, cousin of Dawn Wiener from \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\". Dawn has just recently killed herself (no surprise there, really), and a five-year old, and black, Aviva vows to never be like her cousin. Eight years later, Aviva (now white, teenaged, and overweight) has her first sexual encounter and gets pregnant. Her mother (Ellen Barkin, in a truly inspired performance) tells Aviva (still white, but now skinny and with red hair) that she will have to have an abortion. Aviva is devastated, as she longs to be a mother. Following the botched procedure, Aviva runs away and embarks on a transformative journey.You've likely guessed that the transformation here is physical, not spiritual. Aviva changes appearance from chapter to chapter, but the person she is inside never changes. Whether she's a skinny white girl or a massive black woman Aviva is still a lost little girl, adrift in a world she can't understand. All she has to go by are her warped perceptions of love, which lead her to the arms of a pervert who likes to go out and kill abortion doctors in his free time.\"Palindromes\" leans heavily to the side of pro-life. Solondz vilifies abortion clinics and pro-choicers to an almost extreme degree. Here are examples:Aviva's mother refers to an unborn child as being \"like a tumor\". Aviva is shown a dump where aborted fetus' are haphazardly thrown away. The clinic botches the abortion. Aviva's pro-choice family includes an accused child molester.I was rather shocked at first, being a pro-choice person myself, but I can not deny that Solondz has created a powerful indictment of the practice of abortion. I'll never give up the pro-choice platform (everyone has a right to choose, after all), but now I'm not so sure I'd ever personally want an abortion for any of my loved ones.Solondz also shows that unwanted children don't necessarily have to be aborted, and that they can have good lives if adopted or sent to foster homes. When Aviva meets Mama Sunshine, \"mother to all of God's children\", we are shown a household where disabled and sick children can lead happy lives. Mama Sunshine has taken in blind children, crippled children, limbless children, and retarded children, and she gives them all good lives. It makes you wonder if Aviva couldn't have given her child a life like this rather than having to be forced to kill it.At the end of it all \"Palindromes\" ends appropriately. IE: as it began. There is a wonderful scene in which Aviva's (supposedly) perverted relative makes a speech about how no one changes, how life is essentially a palindrome. It makes us wonder if the effort Aviva went through to change things was worth it, when we know where she'll always end up. Or do we? Does life have to be a palindrome? Or is there a way to change that, once and for all?This is the year's boldest, most provocative film. It is fearless in it's search for answers, and it requires the viewer to be fearless if they are to get anything out of watching. Please see this film.

This idea of value was made all the more real when these dreadful cartoons were put up against the animated powerhouse that was 'The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour'. Tom & Jerry looked absolutely sterile by comparison when put up against the likes of Bugs, Daffy, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote? Actually, Tom & Jerry did most of the same things the Looney Toons crew would do when it came to the art of the chase, it's just that Tom & Jerry did their chasing without any hint of humor that the Warner Brothers cartoons had in spades. That may sound a bit harsh to Tom & Jerry fans, but Tom & Jerry don't stack up against any two teamers offered up through the ranks of the Looney Toons.When I happened to find one of Tom & Jerry's cartoons (Filet Meow) tacked onto the end of a movie I had TiVoed off of Turner Classic Movies, I decided to see if Tom & Jerry were really as sterile and dire as I remembered. This was their big chance at redemption. I was no longer a child, so this time around Tom & Jerry would have my undivided attention, Bugs and friends were not competing on another channel, and as luck would have it, it wasn't a Saturday morning.There's no use in explaining the plot line of any cartoon, let alone this one.

Soon enough, strange phone calls begin to occur, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute quickness, and she keeps ranting and raving about her ex-husband who used to beat her. It's funny to see Roger believe her through all this stuff. That's until a frumpy co-worker tells him to go snooping through her belongings like a nosy housewife.

After producing Stuart Gordon's first few films, Yuzna decided to pick up the creative end and began directing with BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR. Since then he has helmed a steady stream of horror titles that all have one thing in common; they are well made and full of outlandish ideas but never really good. His latest ROTTWEILER continues the trend.But ROTTWEILER sets itself apart from the Yuzna canon with its extremely bizarre plotting. Set in the future (the only way to possibly explain a half dog/half machine), the film plods along from point A to point B without much originality (think THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME mixed with THE TERMINATOR). Refuges get caughtbad guy molests womanlovebirds get separatedguy escapes prisonmonster dog chases. But then, at roughly the 40 minute mark, things take a bizarre turn. Our hero Dante is trying to catch fish in a stream when the Rottweiler shows up. The dog then chases the naked Dante down the river and then tackles him off a cliff. Dante escapes and finds refuge with a mother and her young daughter. The mother holds Dante at bay with a shotgun and then proceeds to rape him. All the while the robo-pooch is stalking up to the house. Maybe Yuzna was trying to work in some kind of \"man as beast\" metaphor there? But the weirdness doesn't stop there. After escaping from the dog for the 769th time, Dante is visited by the gory ghost of a former friend who tells Dante that his girlfriend is working as a prostitute in the city. Dante goes there only to find out that his girlfriend has been dead for quite some time. In fact, he was there when she was murdered. According to the flashback, she slept with Naschy to save their hides but jealous Dante was having none of that so he hit the road while Kufard unleashed his pet enforcer on Dante's girl. Dante is only a few steps away when this happens but only reacts after she has been torn to pieces. He beats the dog with a lead pipe which is the impetus for this entire long chase. As Kufard simply puts it, \"You hurt my dog!\"The cast for the film is serviceable. For Euro fans there is the welcome treat of Paul Naschy as the main villain Kufard. It is good to see Naschy in something that wasn't shot over four days (I'm still trying to forget that Fred Olen Ray monstrosity) and, although he is on screen for probably 20 minutes total, he gives the film's most commanding performance. Well, other than Zeus as the titular beast. Lead William Miller, looking like a cross between Owen Wilson and Mitch Hedberg, is pretty bad but you have to cut him some slack when most of his lines are, \"Go to helllllllllllllll!\"In terms of the small but appreciated \"scientifically enhanced dog\" film genre, this one is on the same level as 1993's MAN'S BEST FRIEND but pales in comparison to Earl Owensby's 1982 3-D classic DOGS OF HELL.

The Cinematography is quite good, and exemplifies many earlier examples of Japanese Cinema with their frequent use of nature interlude shots. The film seemed childish at first, in the manner in which the characters were portrayed.But upon reviewing the film again, I noted that it was actually more child-like. There was a mature comedic sense of what a child loves in a film about ninjas and samurai sword fights. I could appreciate the nostalgic sense of the old samurai films that was ably caught. The villains seem comic in many ways, and yet there is more than 1 dimension to the group of them. The use of anachronism in the film was to me particularly funny. I won't provide any spoilers, because they are readily apparent when you encounter them in viewing the film.Anyways, if you want a light movie for Saturday night viewing with the kids, or with friends gathered around a bowl of popcorn, and want a good offbeat romantic adventure film, this is certainly one to try.</td><td>rw1134373</td><td>Deeper than one might expect</td><td>sturmritter</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 5)</td><td>Mysterious Skin (2004)</td><td>10</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>Great movie! Finally some honesty about hustling. But lacking, I feel, in honesty about child molestation. Not all child victims become either homosexual or putative alien abductees. Like Araki, I have some knowledge about this.For the uninitiated, it would seem that if you are molested you immediately become maladjusted and cross-sexual. Moreover, if at age 8, you see your promiscuous mother having sex, you immediately react by falling in the love with the stud she services. Not true.Despite its excellent plot and acting, what I fear the most about this movie is that it becomes a textbook for people who have no direct experience with the victims of child abuse. In effect, I fear, as always, the ignorance of the masses.What happens to Neil and Brian, COULD indeed happen, and probably has, but it is not a formula, and I KNOW it will be taken this way by many viewers. X = Y. So I rate the movie a ten, but with the caveat that it is not for everyone. There are---actually-----people who should not see this movie. We have enough witch hunts.Priests, little league coaches, boy scout troupmasters....it doesn't matter. I reckon that one out of three of us has been abused in some way as children, but to propose that this is some sort of malevolent predestiny is just wrong.I see it this way: Let's make a movie about some horribly greedy Jew in Germany in 1930, one who cheats everyone and profits. I'm sure there must have been at least one. But let's make it in the general sense where ALL Jews are seen to be this way, at least by implication.Mysterious Skin is, by implication, a gross generalization.So viewers beware.</td><td>rw1134374</td><td>Great movie!

The series ended with long time friends Fletcher and Godber in the local pub relaxing and Fletch saying he was so glad to be out of prison, so he could do simple things in life like enjoy a nice pint of bitter in the pub etc.For some reason this show was axed after just one series because people ether A) Thought it was not as good as its predecessor \"porridge\" or B) it got low ratings (This I'm not sure of,), but the series provided just as many laughs as \"porridge\" and it also won a BAFTA award, plus Ronnie Barker himself has said that he thought \"Going Straight\" was just as good as \"Porridge\".In closing if you are a fan of Porridge and good old Norman Stanley Fletcher, this series (Available now on DVD) is a must, I guarantee you will enjoy as much or even more so then \"Porridge\".</td><td>rw1134375</td><td>Going Straight</td><td>janicepritchard</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 3)</td><td>Aitraaz (2004)</td><td>null</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>Means : Objection , protest, opposition  the opposite of approval  Story line : Hunk hero falls in love with a model aspiring to make it very big in life  by hook or by crook.

It was what I would expect from Rob Zombie. It has it's corny moments, it's scary moments, it's brutal moments, it's sexy (slutty, actually) moments..etc. Just like the cheap B movies that we know Rob is so fond of.But Devil's Rejects wasn't like it's predecessor. It is a scary, unnerving, nauseating, sadistic, mind **** from beginning to end. Now, I knew it would be more 'realistic', I guess, because of the environment. The actual house in \"House\" was creepy, with Baby's room with the dolls, and Tiny's room, with the people locked up in the cages of dirty laundry. Especially in Dr. Satan's lair, lined with skulls, zombie-like experiments and dead bodies. Devil's rejects lacks that extra color, but makes up for it with extremely bothersome imagery. There is no restraint, or mercy in this movie. There is nothing cartoonish about it either.There is another review on this site that says the same things I am saying, but since I agree, I will reiterate.I've been complaining that all the recent horror movies have stunk, and are just cheap thrill fests. I went to Devil's Rejects and expected to see campy Zombie evil/fun, but instead got that scary movie I've been looking for. The characters were very well developed, however I do think good IL' Wydell was a bit over the top, especially during the little get together with the film expert, and a fight almost ensues for Elvis not being appreciated. Other than that, the character acting was great. And don't get me wrong, it has it's humor and funny moments, however sadistic they may be. They were all pretty funny.To sum up, the movie was superb. A good step for Zombie, while switching it up, and possibly losing a couple fans, he has struck a nerve in a genre that needed it, so hopefully this movie goes over well in the Box Office, and Zombie gets some funding for some more gorefests.Too bad Grandpa couldn't be in this one :-( he was pretty funny.</td><td>rw1134378</td><td>What the genre needed..but....</td><td>Zombafyed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 9)</td><td>Lung do kei yuen (2005)</td><td>4</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>I saw this film this evening at the Freer Gallery in Washington, DC, as part of their 10th Annual Made in Hong Kong Festival.

It has action, a story that makes sense, high entertainment and... a babe ;-) More seriously, the story is amazing and the acting is pretty good.Many reviewers say that The Island is actually two movies stuck together - one, an exploration of a pretty dim universe and the second, a totally run of the mill action flick. I must agree with that. The first half is a very well made exercise in imagination and set design. The second part suffers from terminal Michael Bay-ism - way too many car chases, way too many explosions, way too many \"boooms, bangs and wowwwwwwws\".Contrary to many summer movies, The Island does NOT require a major suspension of disbelief: the story really makes sense. I'll try to see other movies written by the same team.The acting is very good. The two principals deliver as well in action scenes than in funny scenes (there are a few :-) Sean Bean plays a variation of his typical bad-guy role but he excels in it. Djimon Hounsou (the other Gladiator :-) is good but he has his ups and lows... Steve Buscemi is, as usual, a genius.The special effects are... too good? Micheal Bay seems to have mastered the art of milking too much money from producers - the car chases scenes are well made and are obviously expensive but they kinda distract from the story line. Personally, i would have removed a good half of them.I didn,t notice any major plot holes, besides the fact that the main characters are pretty indestructible... I wouldn't take life insurance on them, it would be a bad bet...There is a lot of product placement in this movie and, at one point, it gets laughable. Watch for a character to be using MSN Search in 2050... Please... Contrary to Minority Report, the cars of the future are not Japanese, there good ole' Cadillacs - I knew the US car industry would come back on top! ;-) Finally, I may buy the soundtrack...

The guy got killed in a car accident but his \"soul\" was transferred to cyberspace so he can cheerfully go on with his modus operandi of slaughtering everybody who's in Karen Allen's address book. Considering the premise of this film is so ridiculous, you'd expect that the cast -and crew members themselves wouldn't take their jobs very seriously, right? Well hell no! There's absolutely no sense of humor in the script and every 'actor' devotedly produces his/her lines like as if they are part of some eminent Hitchcock production. The overuse of visual, headache-provoking effects is very annoying and also pretty pointless, since no one really knows how a soul floating around in cyberspace must be portrayed. So all they do is showing some wild and colorful images that look like irritating screen-savers. There's no suspense (or what else did you expect) and the gore  although plenty  is not at all convincing. The only element worth mentioning (childish of me as well, I know) is the supportive role of a young and ambitious actress called Shevonne Durkin.

There she meets the munchkins, a scarecrow, a tin man and a lion and off they go to Oz to get their prayers answered. Ahhh, but wait! This is of course the 1970's, so all the songs you see have to be Disco songs, and since this is a rather urbanized version the characters have all been updated to reflect this. Some of it works, and some of it doesn't. The whole disco thing of course, is now out of whack, and it's most famous song, \"Ease On Down\" sounds terribly out of date now.

The ironic thing is that for the very few people that are NOT sad sacks, are the ones who are somewhat immoral, and cheating on their wives and what not. Or, when you're drunk, or both. Take a look at the Christmas party at C.C. Baxter's company during Christmas time. Compare it with any other time, where it's deadly serious and quiet. So why is it that the sadder ones have the more worries and the more happy ones seem to fly by without a care in the world? I'm not sure, and I think this is one of the problems leaves up to the viewer, which I think is quite brilliant. Jack Lemmon is, what he always seems to be, and that's brilliant.

Alas there is nothing in between. Only 25 miles away, is England's neighbour, France, which makes regular masterpieces, of which this is a prime example. It is set in the recent past, the late 40's, and concerns the redemption of a failed musician posted to a rural boy's school for rough kids and orphans. Gradually, and you know he will, he forms a choir from these no-hopers, transforming their lives and his own. It is full of charm, warmth, in the best classical way of film-making. A splendid effort, and rightly belongs in your DVD library. Excellent acting,art direction, confident and intelligent direction (surely big projects will now come his way). The music CD is on the best seller charts throughout Europe and understandably so. The music is different by juxtaposition: you see these poorly dressed scruffy boys, living under a repressive regime, yet singing ditties by Rameau like angels about dreams, oceans, and zephyrs. A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, released at the same time, is a big slick version of quirky Gallic charm, and also excellent, full of crane moves, great cameraman's set ups, and a big-scale version of personal versus macro scale ( a fiancée searching for her missing soldier who did not return from the WW1 trenches ) yet between the two, THE CHORUS lingers in the mind with a fondness and a smile.</td><td>rw1134389</td><td>A Wonderful Warm Life Affirming Film That Only The French Can Make</td><td>nicniewart</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 4)</td><td>Eau de la vie (1993)</td><td>9</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>I'm still relatively new to short films, and I'm amazed at how such a small, short story can excite and fascinate me. This film had me stare at the screen in horror, sitting on the edge of my seat. I must congratulate this film on having had such an excellent effect on me.Eau de la Vie takes us to a world where the gap between rich and poor is huge and - at least in the eyes of the truly decadent elite - a (poor) life isn't worth anything. In a posh restaurant, a group of people is celebrating a young woman's entering their class. She's treated warmly by all of them - or at least that is the first impression. Then it comes to choosing the \"entertainment\" for the evening. The choice is left to the heroine, who knows just as little as the audience what this is supposed to mean. She is to select one person out of a group of four intimidated looking people, a middle-aged man and woman, a young, handsome young man and a little girl. She obviously doesn't know what this is about, but quickly picks the young man. As he is then stripped of his clothes and locked into a glass tank, and as the tank slowly fills with water, it finally becomes clear what the \"entertainment\" is supposed to be: watching a man drown. The heroine's reaction to this situation was quite terrifying for me to watch, since I almost entirely shared her horror. I could not help but feel relieved in the end, but when I came to think about it later, my initial relief couldn't hold. This solution isn't really one, I fear, and if anything, the other characters' reaction in the very end is in fact utterly, utterly disgusting.This film is really disturbing. It's a bitterly evil, dark satire of society. I was told after this film that it's been inspired by the political situation in New Zealand at that time. Not knowing anything about New Zealand, I cannot judge whether this is correct, and how appropriate such a grim view is... but who cares?

Why does this guy still have a career? It's pretty obvious that he has nothing but contempt for his audience. The scenery and photography is great, the supporting actors are fine (especially the exotic female love interest), the plot and the writing are OK (if a little hackneyed); in other words the overall content of the movie is good B movie stuff (with some inspired directorial touches in a lot of places). And into this potentially pleasing and exciting melange comes Steven Seagal, who sleep walks through the entire thing as if he had pressing business elsewhere and spends the entire movie with his inner dial set to 'squinty eyed tough guy' and using one of two expressions -('squinty eyed scowl' and 'eyes slightly widened'). I've watched a lot of movies (even a lot of action and martial arts movies) and I've rarely seen a lazier \"lead\" performance than this. You doubt me? Check out the fight scenes - Seagal used to do nice, snappy Aikido/Aikijutsu style fight choreography, and his gunfight choreography was fast, fluid and visceral. Now he uses a stunt double for any scene involving kicking, leaping, or leg fencing. Now he seems to be pretending to be some kind of Tai Chi master and Hung Gar stylist, with a lot of extraneous wire work to hid the fact that he isn't putting ANY 'oomph' or speed into his motions (no matter how hard the director tries to frame him, he's obviously loafing); in fact, Seagal can hardly be bothered to raise his hands above his head or pick his feet off the floor anymore. And he's gotten really fat - the generous fit of the loose kung-fu GI and the numerous flattering camera angles can't disguise his girth or the way his neck balloons out of the shirt collar to give him wattles and a double chin. Almost anyone other actor with a martial arts background and a 'tough guy' persona could have taken the lead role in this move (Jet Li, Gordon Liu, Donnie Yen, or even Don Wilson or Oliver Grunier) and done a better job. Heck, David Carradine could have pulled this off with aplomb. In fact, this could have been a killer movie with a relative unknown in the part. one that could take some acting direction and was eager to prove himself. But someone somewhere still thinks that Seagal's name can sell a movie, and so he gets to grunt out another performance. There are also some weaknesses to the plot that aren't especially Seagal's fault, but I'll blame him anyway: Of course, he gets the exotic Thai call girl in the end for no apparent reason other than the plot requires it. Seriously, there is literally almost NO transition between the point where they are allies and when they are lovers- it's a couple of lines of dialog and that's it. And Seagal's friend the Buddhist Monk comes out of seclusion to help him rescue his daughter, and is immediately able to leap into demanding physical action after 10 years of asceticism, living on 1200 starch based calories and an average of 4 hours of sleep each day. And Southeast Asia apparently has its own brand of voodoo mind control, because a weird shaman type appears for 10 seconds nears the beginning of the movie, and never shows up again until Seagal's final showdown with the bad guy, and then the shaman starts sticking pins into a voodoo doll to slow Seagal down only to be fought off somehow by the chanting and good vibes of the remaining monks. The whole thing is so badly and transparently handled that it will leave you scratching your head in confusion. The plot element is completely out of place in this kind of movie and makes no sense. (It might work in a 'sword play' style movie). The film makers just threw it in there to make Hopper/Seagal even more of a knee-jerk hero than before - the monks are on his side and fight for him, so he MUST be a HERO, right? I sound as if I hate this movie. I don't. I like almost everything about the movie except Seagal, and even he doesn't suck all that much here. It's just that I can't imagine any actor in a leading role of an action movie who has even a shred of self respect doing this little actual work and expecting his fans to accept it.

Although it incorporates almost all the standard motifs and story ideas from traditional Hong Kong films, the filmmakers made dozens of choices, both major and minor, that implement these old-time plot devices and visual clichés with a vehemence like few films you've ever seen. From the sheer viciousness and cruelty of the featured weapon ( the Flying Guillotine, which yanks off heads at the neck), to the implacable ruthlessness and seeming unstoppability of the Master (who is a genuinely unsettling and scary guy) to the carefree brutality of the tournament duels, to the ear-splitting Foley and sound effects to the offbeat and ruthless strategies and tactics of the one-armed boxer to kill the killers who are after him...man, you will be talking about this movie to anyone who will listen for years after you see it.Any fan of Hong Kong film making ought to see this film at least once.</td><td>rw1134395</td><td>Has to be seen to be believed</td><td>lemon_magic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(28, 31)</td><td>Batman and Robin (1949)</td><td>7</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>I was fumbling through the DVD section in Wal-Mart, and what do I find? The 1949 Batman and Robin complete serial!!! Newly released by Columbia! Being a true fan of the caped crusader, how could I NOT want to watch it??!! OK, folks, let's get real, don't watch this if you are looking for high-tech special effects, brilliant dialogue, women (there's only one and she's a main character, Vicki Vale...who is always \"getting in trouble\", with Batman having to save her!), a Batmobile or any Bat-gadget! This serial was made at a time when studios spared all expense in making \"fluff\" to appeal to kids when they went to the movies on Saturday mornings. (Don't scoff, all you baby boomers....cartoon makers of the 1970s did the same thing...with the same bad dialogue and bad acting...witness \"Superfriends\", (which I also liked!), they just did it for Television!) I started watching this serial having never seen it...only saw a little of it in the special features of the 1966 Batman movie DVD. The costume is silly...looks like Bruce Wayne's grandmother sewed it together...Robin's costume isn't much better....there is no Batmobile, (although Batman and Robin do ride around in a Mercury convertible, and even change costumes in it..hmmmm..homo erotica? NAH!!), and no Bat-gadgets, although there is a neat scene where Bruce Wayne uses a device in the Batcave to \"retore\" a burned photo-negative. (I also giggle at all the shadows of flying bats in the cave....but you NEVER see a bat!) What there is is a good story! A super-villain..namely \"The Wizard\", whom the episodes lead you to think is an old, wheelchair bound scientist, who, when he sits in a chair that looks like it was stolen from the state penitentiary's execution room, regains the use ofhis legs...and puts on a black costume, shrouding his entire body, and, using a stolen bit of technology he created, can remotely control all motor vehicles...but not only that, he can make them explode as well, and the pies de resistance....he can make himself INVISIBLE!! He also has the ability to project his image and hypnotize victims with flashing eyes. Truly creepy!!! However, there is a GREAT plot twist at the end to prove who the Wizard REALLY is! As far as the acting is concerned.......there isn't any. I am reminded of Ed Wood flicks like Plan 9 from Outer Space when I watch it...but why not? George S. Plympton was one of the writers...wasn't he a friend of Ed's??? There is little emotion portrayed by the actors...everyone says their lines in a manner-of-fact way, however, the story is so good and action so fast-paced, you really don't notice it. What I DID notice and what made me giggle, was that EVERY male performer, except the Wizard so far, wears a Fedora!!! They all look like they were in some old gangster movie!! I originally wrote this review after seeing only 6 of the 15 episodes...it was difficult to turn the DVD player off after the 6th episode...but, I wanted something fun to watch tomorrow!! I came back and corrected some incorrect information I gave AFTER finishing the series. If you're a die-hard Batman fan, you should like this, unless you get upset by movies not following the comic's story lines! Those of you who like to get a glimpse of a time gone by, you'll LOVE this! It's not possible for me to give this serial 10 out 10 stars, mainly because of the bad acting....however, it certainly earns at least 7!

The truth is this is pseudo-SF written by SF illiterates who can't even do some quick fact checking.The basic premise of the show was that, seeing the Vogon hyperspace bypass construction crew coming (or whatever unspecified fate befell the planet) the Leaders of Mankind shoved hundreds of different cultures from Earth in biospheres on a giant Space Ark and set it off across the Universe looking for a new home. (The words 'Eggs' and 'Basket' immediately spring to mind, but what the hey...) The spheres were sealed off from one another to maintain cultural diversity. But Something Went Wrong! (as it always does) and the ship is now out of control. Three wanderers from one of the spheres finds out the TRUTH and, unable to return to their own agrarian, culture wander the corridors of the ship looking for someone who knows how to steer it.Starlost is Canada's second greatest contribution to crap SF TV (first place goes to William Shatner) and is one of those SF shows where the automatic sliding doors make more noise GBZZZZZZZZshup! - than the ray guns do. pew! The show only ran for 16 episodes before it was taken outside and shot (so this \"movie\" is 12.5% of the whole run) and with stunning dialogue like this (between a silver hot-panted Space Bimbo and Kier Dullea as \"Devon\" trying to hide behind his moustache) you can see why it was put out of its misery:Space Bimbo:You've never tasted food like this before...Devon: I've never seen statues that change before or people who appear and disappear before my eyes before eitherJust try saying that out loud - it is unspeakably bad dialogue, and again in the same scene a few moment later:Space Bimbo: Is the Ark in any immediate danger?Devon: It could be, we just don't know when!Maybe Canadian dictionaries of the 70s defined \"immediate\" differently than we do now but the writing in this thing is awful. Shot on video and using some heroic Colour-separation overlay work. (though they still hadn't figured out not to pan or zoom while using it. From time to time the backgrounds suddenly lurch or follow the actors around.) The music is annoyingly randomly placed Oeeeeoooo! pling! pling! Space Music. And why is it that in bad TV SF like this ALL strangers are instantly dragged before the Head of State? Imagine if that happened in the USA... every time a Texan border guard spotted someone where he shouldn't be it would be \"Take him to the President, now!\" It's cobblers.As originally conceived the three protagonists were a couple who were in (forbidden) 'lurrrve' and the woman's betrothed who was sworn to kill them but was forced by necessity to help them in their quest. None of that back-story from the pilot show was in evidence here and the three wooden heroes just stood in a row and took turns to step forward and deliver their lines before trying to hide behind one another again.Another great moment: Exploring the inner city setting in the first part of the \"movie\" Garth comes across a big red door marked \"Exit Forbidden\", thinks deeply for a moment then says \"Exit Forbidden? I wonder if this could be the way out...\" No Garth, It's a fugging Bubble-Gum Machine! Of course it's the way out! that's what \"Exit\" means!

Unlike the usual mute superhero Jack Carver talks, and has plenty of sarcasm to dish out. But what makes this game stand out from the others is the setting. Most FPS games are either based on real life warfare or grim and gloomy sci fi. A case in point is Doom III, where you get to spend 12 hours wandering around dark corridors. Farcry is set on a series of tropical islands, and it's amazing simply how beautiful it all is, brightly colored and radiant, except that people are shooting at you. Later on you get the dark and scary stuff, but it doesn't take up the entire game.Farcry also mixes very well military combat with monsters. The mercenaries are only slightly predictable, usually when a scene stretches on too and long and they start looping voice commands or actions, and the trigens are downright scary to face off against. This was also I think the first game to introduce a realistic looking water, which now is a requirement for every new game.Playing the game will take up the better part of a week, and that's before you start tinkering. There's a few different rendering modes to use, and Nvidia 68X0 series cards can enable a primitive form of HDR lighting, which makes things substantially different. It may not be obvious at first, but most levels have a few different ways they can be played, whether you prefer stealth, sniping, or up-front and personal combat. The only flaw Farcry has to me is it's already starting to age. Half-Life 2 brought us synchronized lips and facial expressions, and some things like twisted metal pipes look very blocky, being made out of low-poly count shapes.

Taking place around the time of the third film, many of the living humans have taken refuge inside a walled city. The city's guardian is an armor plated land moving called \"Dead Reckoning\". Inside the city the people are divided by \"The Haves\" (led by Dennis Hopper who over sees the on goings of the civilians and live inside a giant glass tower) \"The Have nots\" are the people who live outside the tower and make it possible for those inside to maintain the life style they have. The movie follows Riley (Simon Baker) who is one of the scavengers that go out in the night and forage for supplies (food and medicine). Cholo (John Leguizamo) is a scavenger who wants to live in the glass tower. He does whats asked of him and more. When he's denied that privilege, Cholo and his buddies hijack Dead Reckoning and threaten to blow up the tower. Meanwhile Riley just wants to get in a vehicle and leave the city for Canada, But those plans are scrapped when he gets into a fracas whilst trying to save Slack (Asia Argento). Riley, Slack and Riley's friend Charlie are locked up in jail cells. But Cholo is running around in D.R. blackmailing Kaufman for a large sum of money (where's he going to spend it I have no idea). Desperate, Kaufman makes a deal with Riley; bring back D.R. and Cholo and he can leave the city. There's a big problem making matters worse. A zombie nicknamed \"Big Daddy\" is organizing all of the living dead. They want one thing. Destroy the tower and Kaufman. Along the way to the walled city, Big Daddy gathers more and more zombies forming a massive zombie army. Kaufman doesn't trust Riley so he has three soldiers follow him (possibly betray him as well). Riley eventually recaptures Dead Reckoning but him and Cholo realize that the same factors that protect the walled city can also make it a huge mausoleum. Instead of fleeing, Riley and the others make a break for the city as Big Daddy and Company barge through. A bloody massacre ensues. The people inside the Glass Tower are so oblivious to life on the outside living in total denial. Reality comes crash down of them when Big Daddy and his motley crew of undead riff-raff bringing them misery and sorrow. Kaufman makes a run for it with his manservant. Big Daddy singles him out and makes a bee line for him. His manservant ditches Kaufman leaving him to face his maker alone. Cholo also has some payback he wants to give to him personally as well. Riley arrives to the city a sees the mess that the zombies have made. He decides to leave north with Dead Reckoning when he learns that the survivors will pick up the pieces and just have to face the reality that their are far too many zombies out there and in order to survive they're going to have to learn to live with them. Satisfied; Riley, Slack, Charlie and the Dead Reckoning crew head off north in search of a place where there are no zombies and people like Kaufman who are trying to hang on to a society that is as dead as the dinosaurs.Years in the making have finally paid off for George A.. Romero. His return to the mainstream and his first zombie movie in twenty years is well worth the wait. Romero knows how to write a movie and this one is no exception. The gore is real high for a R-Rated movie and the acting is pretty good. I like to see Dennis Hopper poking fun of people like himself. The social commentary is excellent and highly entertaining. That's what I enjoy about his movies. People have unfairly slagged this movie for no apparent reason. I don't know why, they should stick to more mainstream Hollywood fair like the Resident Evil series. I wouldn't mind the \"Dead\" series ending here. Romero should continue with the Zombie films but in a different direction. The man knows how to make this genre work!Highly recommended.</td><td>rw1134399</td><td>Cinema of George A.

Clooney, Turturro and particularly Nelson make for a fine latter-day version of the Three Stooges, with plenty of good-natured face-pulling and double-taking. The large cast all make the most of their tongue-twisting lines and good IL' boy wardrobes - I especially like Von Bargen as the Archetypal Coen Demon-Fiend, complete with hell-hound and sunglasses at night. The title of the movie comes from the film Joel McCrea wants to make (but never does) in Preston Sturges' brilliant Sullivan's Travels, and some of the characters are based on real people (King is legendary Delta bluesman Robert Johnson, for example). The links with Homer's epic poem are a bit tenuous to say the least - a guy estranged from his wife seeking to win her back, some sirens, a Cyclops (sort of) - and the script sometimes feels like it's a collection of funny episodes strung together rather than a coherent story, but it's so much fun that it doesn't really matter. Director of photography Roger Deakins captures a fabulous sepia-toned look to the rural scenes and there are plenty of wonderful visual touches - my favourite being the moment the flood comes and as everything is submerged a school of Clooney's Dapper Dan haircream tins perform an impromptu little aqua-ballet before our eyes.

With the police hunting him in force and a reward on his head, Johnny is forced to flee through the city at night, unable to trust anyone.This movie has an interesting amoral dramatic structure - it puts a bad man (a terrorist, robber and killer) in the lead, and then asks you to sympathise with him. It does this by emphasising his altruistic qualities (loyalty, friendship, courage) and his suffering - he literally bleeds to death for almost the whole film, the night is bitterly cold, he's slowly losing his mind and almost everyone is out to get him. The drama comes from the other characters' relationships with him - those who love and admire him (sweetheart Ryan and friend Beatty), those who want to exploit him (informer Delaney, hobo McCormick and artist Newton) and those who don't want to get involved with him (cabbie Tomelty and bartender Hartnell). In the end though, I can't empathise with McQueen no matter how much he suffers (unlike, for example, Alex in A Clockwork Orange, who is much worse), because he's responsible by his own actions for the mess he's in. The \"Organisation\" is of course a nom-de-guerre for the Irish Republican Army (and the unnamed city probably Belfast) but the film doesn't make the mistake of addressing political issues - it's purely a drama, full of compassion and insight into human nature. Very well made and acted, with great moody photography by Robert Krasker and terrific sets by Roger K. Furse and Ralph Brinton. Written by F.L. Green and R.C.

The movie itself has a (very well made) depressing, revolting touch; two young men on a slum-like neighborhood of Goiânia, a large city on Brazilian's Mid-West, trying to find a way to get some money, go to a demolished hospital, where they end up finding a strange and heavy lead thing with a small steel container inside. They pick both, and then they head to Devair (Nelson Xavier)'s junk shop. Devair buys the lead thing, but says the steel box is just trash, since there's no use for it... the two \"looters\" then decide to give it to him, after all, there's no use keeping a heavy and useless steel box. A curious Devair decides to check out what is that stuff... he opens the container, and see some tiny stones on it. Guessing that's nothing valuable in it, he goes back to his daily life, until he found out that those little stones produced a shining blue light...Fascinated, he then gives some stones to everyone he knows, as a gift, but, for some weird reason, everyone starts getting ill and with small burns...Through the film, you can see lots of displays of ignorance of the population, who blames food, sins, and even lunching at a friend's house on a Sunday. It was a real tragedy, specially because it could be avoided by simple means. About 10 people have died (officially, only 4...), and lots are suffering with tumors, cancer, and amputations.

If you're going to release a three hour epic, then more has to happen, or actors have to act better, and scripters have to script better than this.Brad Pitt comes off best of the star cast, and in spite of looking like a nine-year-old Robert Redford at times, shows - for Tinseltown - a lot of subtlety, and carries off the comic angles to the script. He and Jake Weber as the creepy bad guy spark off each other well.Anthony Hopkins does his usual irritating 'slow, slow, quick quick slow' performance, and I got the feeling that they could have shaved a welcome half hour off the running time without his pregnant - er - pauses. And, er... portentous - um - procrastinations. Get on with it, man! Stop mumbling! The script is turgid enough!Clare, the totty, nods her head a lot. A hell of a lot. The face of L'Oreal 2001, I gather. I wonder how they got her to keep her head still long enough for the photos? This film may well have stalled her movie career, but at least she got three hours for her showreel.The supporting cast are pretty good on the whole; Jake Weber makes the ridiculous maguffin about the company takeover almost credible. But the Quince character (Jeffrey Tambor) has no place in a global media empire, even if he did marry the boss's frumpy daughter (a good turn from Marcia Gay Harden). And the character's obviously gay; they could have ramped that up. Even the outrageous Bill-Joe relationship is not commented on by supposedly high-powered executives. Brad's too pretty!The main plot about Death hanging about the old man gives you enough to think about to sustain your interest (kinda Bergman) until the immeasurably tedious and tacky party sequence. Then you stop caring, and begin to wonder about things, like:If he's a media tycoon, where did he get such a terrible band? (They make James Last sound like Guns 'n' Roses)Why does he spend most of his 65th birthday party in his home office when he's just retired - knowing he's going to die? Why are none of the members of the board at his party, when they're all available for a phone conference? Who cares whether overprivileged stuffed shirts live or die anyway?And the big twist: (SPOILER)Right, so Death leaves Brad Pitt's body, and takes Anthony Hopkins anyway. I read you that far. But it's got more holes than a cheese grater. How come Brad - suddenly even goofier - is physically 100%? Didn't the hospital, where the daughter Susan is such a brilliant part-time resident, hear about the accident? So do they never find Bill Parrish's body in the grounds? And do Susan and Joe - who must have to change his name - never resolve how he disappeared off the street and woke up weeks later at her Dad's party? Didn't his family miss him? And how come Death can't tie a tie, but knows enough to wash, shave, and change his boxer shorts regularly?You see, you start to ask these things in the pauses and longeurs of this movie, of which there is an abundance towards the end. Someone has already mentioned the annoyance of watching the angst of the fabulously wealthy. The main problem is the time it takes to get there, and your disbelief is unsuspended about half an hour short.

Is the one-sided nature of the conflict (overwhelming villain, hapless or helpless victim) part of the appeal for us? Do we \"identify with\" the chaser or the chasee? Should we feel a little ashamed of ourselves afterwards? Or, as Captain Spaulding put it, are these just a bunch of jack-ass questions?\" Apparently not... For his \"not a sequel\" \"The Devil's Rejects\" Rob Zombie eschews his previous \"kitchen sink\" approach to keep his camera mercilessly unblinkingly focused on the depredations (both physical and psychological) performed upon those doomed souls whose path happens to collide with Captain Spaulding and (we're now specifically informed) his kids Otis and Baby. Someone commented that at times this was like watching a \"snuff film\"; there's definitely a kind of \"Here it is take it or leave it\" atmosphere. Some have accused Zombie of \"glorifying\" or at least \"siding with\" the vicious killers but if one looks at what's actually on screen instead of the baggage one brings with one, all he's really doing is showing us what's happening. If we accuse Zombie of \"wallowing in\" the nastiness because he won't cut away from it, maybe he wants to remind us that pain and death really aren't just special effects; a bad deed only ends when the doer stops or is stopped. Maybe we're so used to all the eye-blink editing in movies the last few decades (such as Zombie himself used in \"House\") that we've come to expect cinematic mayhem to have that kind of built-in \"brain cushion.\" Really, there's a lot less violence in \"Rejects\" than in \"House,\" and it's a lot more conventionalmost of the deaths are by gun, a few by knife, one person gets squashed by a truck, which latter I knew was coming since she was standing in the damn road so damn long, so that lessened the impact (on me, not on the character). The most painful thing for me to watch was the woman slapping her mother in the face so that Baby would allow her to use the bathroom; there again, Zombie's point seemed to be to ask just what people are willing to do. Personally I'd p--- my pants before I'd slap my mother to amuse some vermin, but maybe it's different for women. (Yeah, I know the character planned to use the bathroom break to try to escape, but how did she know Baby wouldn't just follow her into the bathroom to watch? That would've been right up Baby's alley.) Zombie's technical proficiency should no longer be in any doubt. I imagine he got the performances he wanted; of the three leads, Sid Haig as Spaulding comes off the best with the character no longer having to perform the clown role except once to scare a young boy (reportedly there's an autobiographical element there for Zombie). Spaulding takes a kind of 1960's approach to life---\"If you can't eat it, drink it, smoke it or s---w it, it's useless.\" We don't learn much more than before about his back-story although he's now called \"Cutter\" several times. Bill Moseley as Otis is oddly subdued under his new beard, a far cry from his previous persona bellowing \"I HOPE YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE\" or \"RUN RABBIT RUN.\" (That line gets borrowed by William Forsythe's bloodlusting sheriff near the end, although how the sheriff would have known to use the line is unclear.) He almost sounds preoccupied as he challenges God to strike him dead etc. Mrs. Sheri Moon Zombie as Baby, praise the powers that be, jettisons that excruciatingly annoying cackle for the most part. All three get to do some actual acting late in the going as the sheriff (seeking revenge for his dead brother, who shows up in his dreams) turns the tables on them, letting them experience horror from the receiving as opposed to the dispensing side. The new Mother Firefly picks up where Karen Black left off re over-the-top histrionics, but she does manage to convey an inner depravity so old that it almost seems a Pavlovian reflex when she waggles her tongue at Forsythe. Forsythe, as usual, owns the screen whenever he's on it. Kudos to personal favorite Danny Trejo and a big scarred lug unknown to me as a couple of bikers for hire, the kind of casual stone-bad-asses for whom the goofy serial-killer types are about as alarming as excrement on their boots. My favorite scene was with Charlie the pimp and his minion (a sadly aging Michael Berryman from \"The Hills Have Eyes\" ) buying a couple of chickens from an enormous redneck concerned lest his merchandise be used for sexual purposes. It's profanely surreally funny with sharply written dialogue, unlike the \"F--- you!\" \"Well, f--- you too!\" etc. we get for much of the running time. ....Those expecting Zombie to use his own music for \"Rejects\" will be disappointed (I admit I was). It's mostly Southern-rock classics that we've heard on the radio a million times. Gee whiz, we even get \"Free Bird\" at the end as the soon-to-be-satanically-rejected ride off to their final lead-filled confrontation with law enforcement who, by the way, need to take a course in how to storm a building containing armed suspects.... If Zombie had to use Lynryd Skynryd at the end, why not \"Gimme Back My Bullets\"? I really could have done without the film critic scene; it was funny but seemed absolutely inserted; okay, Marx Brothers characters' names, we get it, we got it before. I know a lot of real critics haven't been kind to Rob but there must've been some other way to get back at them. I would've rather had the Dr. Satan scene that he reportedly shot but didn't use---maybe Dr. Satan torturing a film critic? ..</td><td>rw1134405</td><td>Echoes of Otis, \"hope you like what you see...\"</td><td>fred-287</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 5)</td><td>Speed Cross (1980)</td><td>6</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>You gotta hand it to the Italians.

What's really neat about the Italians is that scripts & performances really didn't matter, often being reused from movie to movie, just like their stock pool of B movie actors.So what distinguishes individual examples of Italian cult cinema are the people involved: This one happens to be about racing motorcycles and stars Fabio Testi as an undercover cop who infiltrates the closed world of professional motocross racing to solve an old case and settle a personal score, or something to that extent. The movie mixes stock footage of motorcycle races with scenes of off-tack intrigue that when edited together & given a musical score function as a feature length narrative.This film has a lot of almost Gladitorial bike riding with competing riders trying to force each other off the road combined with a political corruption subplot, and may have been inspired by ROLLERBALL with James Caan. Such concerns are irrelevant -- The movie has a familiarity to it that is decidedly Italian in it's proprietary nature. You don't have to see a lot of motocross racing movies to enjoy the show, and as offbeat, obscure macho man entertainments go this one is pretty good, even if it is all pretty silly after all is said & done.\"Relaxingly stupid\", with a fine disco era soundtrack, excellent color photography, a good buddy role for Fabio's sidekick, and another gem of an appearance by my hero, the late Romano Puppo, playing a bare-fisted motocross thug named \"Kurt Schmidbauer\" who works for Mr. Big. His job? Beating people up: Can you say \"Posthumous Lifetime Achievement Oscar?\" I tell you, give me two hours of this any day and you can keep your Tom Cruise, pointless remakes, juvenile superhero thrillers and movies about whacko candy magnates who creepily resemble Michael Jackson. Hollywood may be out of it's slump but their product is still in decline, and the honesty of these dumb little Italian films is refreshingly invigorating. 6/10.</td><td>rw1134406</td><td>Solid Italian Made Movie About Motorcycle Racing</td><td>Squonkamatic</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 6)</td><td>The Devil's Rejects (2005)</td><td>6</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>This movie is adequate, but it could have been much better. I have a few gripes about the movie, but first I want to give my opinion on some of the better points.William Forsythe was awesome as the sheriff. I don't think anyone else could have done better in portraying the inner struggle with vengeance and he was just gruff enough to put froth that image of a hard ass Texas sheriff.Sid Haig of course was decent, although not as good as in HOTC. It seemed like he didn't have as many lines and not near as many sarcastic scathing tongue-lashings like he did in HOTC either. You do get an interesting scene when he wakes up from a dream next to his... um... girlfriend lol.spoilers to follow:OK now what I didn't like. The stupidity in this movie is amazing. First off, you have sheriffs surrounding the house, getting into position and then the Sheriff simply pulls out the megaphone and announces their presence (expecting them to come out with hands up) and of course this leads to a firefight. Pretty lame indeed, not to mention the shoddy \"Knights of the Round Table\" armor that some of the family had on, which was pretty ridiculous; reminded me of the beast thing that chases around Marc Singer in the beastmaster.Anyway, after that, Baby and Otis escape, get a car only to STOP at a hotel to rest!! Otis is listening to the radio, hears their names all over the radio and decides to stop at the local hotel to rest.. umm OK but I would think you would try to get as FAR AS POSSIBLE from that town. But of course Rob Zombie had to have them come upon an old roadshow band and slaughter them (which also didn't have much creativity).Then you have the Sheriff (after he ties up and beats the hell out of Spaulding and Otis with a tazer/cattle prod type deal and stapler lol) light the house on fire after he douses it with gas, goes outside for at least 10 minutes, yet Otis and Spaulding get SAVED by Tiny who is at best a ripoff of freddy krueger on steroids.I was about to seriously take off a couple points for the ending, as the movie roars into Freebird by Skynard and you are lead to believe that the torrent trio got away scott-free only to meander on a road block with the rest of the sheriff's department. Luckily, for realism's sake they ARE NOT able to drive right through guys with 20 shotguns this time (Should have packed Galahad's armor) The music didn't do it for me either. It seemed to slow down the movie. Rob should have stuck more to his roots and used Metal to keep the pace Quick and Hard instead of twangy, slow and \"drugged\"5.7/10 (mostly in part to Forsythe's great acting)Violence Meter ::::::: 7Nudity ::::: 5Language ::::::::: 9NOT FOR KIDS!!!!</td><td>rw1134407</td><td>Not as good as it could have been</td><td>CyMaddux</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>The Voice Inside (2001)</td><td>7</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>'The Voice Inside' is disturbing although not as horrific as I had been led to believe. It follows the adventures of a nameless average joe as he is tortured by a 'voice' that torments him endlessly.I liked the concept; somebody tormented by a voice and driven to such lengths that he basically mutilates himself, and as the violence gets more and more horrific, as does the humour, in a Peter Jackson 'Bad Taste' sort of way, but I felt that certain things could have been accentuated to exaggerate and enhance this original concept. Small parts of the film, like some of the slowed down sequences, felt unnecessary and slowed the film down, and I also felt the film could have been pushed even more. I know that seems hard to state, considering the amount of grotesque, self-mutilating behaviour that occurs, but something really over the top would have really brought the shock and the self-deprecating humour out even more... such as after the anal sequence, if the intestines fell out or something equally as ludicrous. Either that, or if the anal scene was longer or contained more gruesome close ups or what have you. I also think that when our hero mutilates his face, it would have been nice had he really gone far and if his face was really quite mashed up... I think that would have enhanced the humorous aspect of the movie, as well as the horror. THat being said, the disgust and horror still emerges.The film, in its very concept, is cartoony, and the self-mutilating bludgeoning was very comical. The film and the credits are low-fi and simply done. The camera-work works for what it is, and there is a nice shot when our hero is riding the hammer and he looks up with a look of absolute terror on his face. It really enhances the absurdity and terror of the moment.For me, the most fascinating quality about the film was the idea that the horror is created by the victim, who is both victim and terrorizer. It's also interesting how a hammer, a typically 'male' tool, is used in the film.. especially since a hammer seems the archetypal heterosexual male instrument. the filmmaker seems to be making a statement about masculinity and it's role in horror films... The film seems to be poking fun at the 'inner voice' that's heard in umpteen horrors and thrillers. I found myself wondering about the character... who is he? where is he coming from? what are the pills? and i wonder if the film would have been stronger had these questions been answered. I cannot say. But I found myself wondering what led him to self mutilation and sodomy and wonder if it would have added an extra layer to the film, had we seen the transformation. Otherwise, it's horrific and disturbing, but inexplicable.It's not perfect, and could have been tighter and elements could have been enhanced to bring out the horror and comedy even moreso, but that being said, the film was well done, well edited and manages to shock. The puking and writhing scene at the toilet is classic.</td><td>rw1134408</td><td>i will never look at a hammer in the same way again</td><td>stephenpaultaylor</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(5, 12)</td><td>The Devil's Rejects (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>Wow. seen this opening night and a day later still cant get over it. this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it blows the first one and everything else that has been released in recent memory.I like how rob zombie dropped all the campy humor crap and made the characters more down to earth. the 3 main characters are the most memorable characters i have seen in a movie as far as i can remember the acting was great the soundtrack was awesome and this has been in other reviews but the use of freebird was by far the best use of a song being played over a sequence. the movie had more violence in it then h1000c which is great. no more jokey bull***t the straight up torture scenes were highly entertaining sid haig put again a superb performance of capt spaulding keeping intact the wisecracks and otis was shown more to be a sadist then a lunatic baby was still hot and i cant wait until this comes out on DVD because it is supposed to have all the scenes zombie had to cut out for the R rating which will be a real treat . this movie has one of the best openings and the ending was understandable even though it sucked that the characters died but i wouldn't want endless bad sequels which i know zombie would never do. this movie also opens a great debate that you can hold : who is worse? the main characters or the sheriff? but to sum all this writing up as the title suggests : BEST MOVIE EVER .....peace on the floor not on your shoes</td><td>rw1134409</td><td>Best Movie Ever</td><td>MasterButcher</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(5, 11)</td><td>Adam's Rib (1949)</td><td>7</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Adam's Rib is quite an interesting movie soley based on it's premise and actors alone.

One of the more famous adulterous pairs in history are playing dueling lawyers fighting over a case of a woman who may or may not have shot at her husband because he was cheating? Hmm interesting. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie. Hepburn and Tracy are one of the most famous screen couples in history, and this proves it. Their repartee is amazing here. Also worth noting is the supporting cast, with of course, Judy Holliday in her screen debut as the wife of the philandering husband, and also David Wayne as the staple gay character (After all, this IS a George Cukor movie) All in all, one of the more famous comedies of the 1950;s.</td><td>rw1134410</td><td>Mr and Mrs Pinky</td><td>Spuzzlightyear</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>The Upside of Anger (2005)</td><td>8</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Rarely do I like the post-modern device of telegraphing the ending of a film at the beginning. It usually reeks of pretension, as if the filmmaker is saying, \"My film is so important, it doesn't need trivialities like suspense.\" But done thoughtfully, the technique can build tension and draw in the viewer rather than alienate. This is the Case in The Upside of Anger, which leads off with a scene with the main characters on their way to a funeral. Director Mike Binder uses this to advantage, however, so that each scene is imbued with tension it otherwise would have lacked. Of course the ending will be the hook that draws most into conversation about this film. Is it manipulative? Does it fit? I argue not only does it fit, it gives you two films in one; the one you just saw and the one which you will replay in your mind given the ending. The film is not without flaws. In family films, as with actual families, sometimes one child is given less attention. In Upside, it's Keri Russell's character who almost seems to be from a different family altogether. This may be Binder's point, but by not amalgamating characters, he is forced to balance too many story lines, neglecting more interesting relationships. For example, Binder's character, \"Shep,\" is a gem in this picture and really has a unique point of view. The film seemed to be begging for a final scene between \"Shep\" and Joan Allen's character. The score is also weak, relying on clichéd cues to tell us whether a scene is comic or dramatic. The strength of this picture is that it defies labels  it is a drama with comic moments  and the music belies this. In any case, every single actor is exceptional  especially Costner and Allen's. Every time Costner seems to have slipped into parody, he delivers one of these sublime performances that remind you why he's a screen idol. And if Allen isn't nominated for awards aplenty for her work here, I suppose that would be the downside to The Upside of Anger.</td><td>rw1134411</td><td>Joan of the story arc</td><td>riderpridethemovie</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 10)</td><td>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Charlie And The Chocolate Factory will be labeled and looked at as (what most movie fans fear) a remake. However it's not. It's not even close to the original which starred Gene Wilder and is one of my top 100 favorite films of all time. Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was so far off form the book which was written by Rohl Dahl that Dahl (Who was rumored to detest the original) refused to sign off for a sequel. If Dahl was alive today he would have been very happy with Burton's version. It is practically word for word, scene for scene just like the book of the same name. The plot is simple. Willy Wonka is a candy god. The world worships him. Then for reasons which I will not explain because that would spoil the movie for you he closes his candy factory forever. Then out of the clear blue he decides that he is not only going to open the doors again but he is going to allow five lucky children to tour his factory, something that has never been allowed before. He runs this contest by putting five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The five lucky kids are Augustis Gloop a heavy kid from Germany who lives, breathes, and sleeps for chocolate. Tehn we have Violet Borogard. A little girl from Atlanta Georgia who's motto is winning is everything. She hates finishing any place but the top. Then we have Veruca Salt. A spoiled little rich girl from Birmingham, England. She has a father who's opinion on the world is money can buy everything. There's also Mike Tevee who's life revolves video games. He's a snot nosed punk who will stop at nothing to insult, cut down, or humiliate anyone in his path. Then finally we have Charlie Bucket. A bright little boy who has the heart of gold. He lives in a shack with his parents and his four grandparents. They barely have any money to put food on the table. Charlie is extremely tight with his Grandpa Joe. Who fascinates Charlie with his stories of Willy Wonka. Charlie is the one child who wants this prize more than anybody and deserves it because unlike all the other spoiled brats in the film Charlie is a working class blue collar kid who you just can't help but feel bad for. After the tickets are found the children meet the man who is their hero. Willy Wonka himself played by Tin Burton alumni Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, and the upcoming animated Burton film The Corpse Bride)who holds his own as Mr. Wonka. Milly is nothing what these kids think he's going to be. He's rude, brash, and a complete wise ass. In one scene when Violet throws her arms around him and says \"I'm Violet Borogard\" Wonka looks down at her with an uncomfortable expression and replies \"I don't care\". The chocolate factory is a child's imagination come to life and no one has an eye for eye candy the way Tim Burton does. If you've never seen a Burton film then check out Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, or The Nightmare Before Christmas and you'll see what I mean. This movie has restored my faith in Burton when \"remaking\" a classic (although as i said before this film is not a remake) but I'm a Burton junkie and have loved all his movies, yes even Planet of the Apes (yes I'm the one). After the debacle that was Planet Of The Apes (2000) it looked like Burton's career was over. The movie was a bomb and loathed by most fans that saw it basically giving a lot of heat about the ending (although P.O.T.A. has a better ending than the recent War Of The Worlds remake I've been told)but Burton bounced back with the masterpiece Big Fish. He hasn't dropped the ball since. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is one of Tim Burton's best films and has great eye candy as well as laugh's with Depp's Wonka and the Oompa Loompa's (all played by one man who's been CGI'd to make millions of Oompa Loompa's) and the songs in the films are funny as hell. As for Depp, he hold's his own as Willy Wonka. Believe me he has some big shoes to fill from Gene Wilder's Wonka. However as I said before this movie is so different from the original it falls into the apples and oranges category. It's hard to compare which one is better. The original is still a great film that I will always love. Burton's version ranks right up there with it. Burton's version is almost scene for scene, word for word just like the book. The original is not even close. Which is why I can't even compare the two as well as tell you who was the better Willy Wonka. Again apples and oranges. If you want a good time at the movies where you can just leave your brain at the door and get lost in a weird, wonderful world then i highly recommend Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Burton fans will love it. It ranks up there with Sleepy Hollow, Mars Attacks, Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, and Big Fish. Even people that have never seen a Burton film (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetle Juice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow, Planet Of The Apes, Big Fish and the upcoming Corpse Bride) will have a tough time not enjoying Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. It's a great time at the movies. Heck you'll find yourself wanting to go by candy as soon as the credits begin to roll. On a scale of 10 I give Charlie And The Chocolate Factory a 10. Go and enjoy.

It also makes sure to add, to comedic effect, the \"horror\" of a gay man trying to seduce a straight man. Then, add in a dash of the \"looney grandmother\" who spouts homophobic slurs for laughs.

Before the Oscar-nominated and critically acclaimed Der Untergang (Downfall) about the last days of Hitler he here takes on another angle of the Nazi-past: How ordinary people can become savage beasts when certain conditions arise. Here the reference to Nazis is only short (the guards make the salute to the leader in a two-second scene seen by camera) and the story can be applied much wider: To the recent American and British prisoner abuse in Cuba, Iraq and Afghanistan for example, and to war conflicts in general like the recent civil war in Bosnia.That this is only based on the original Stanford Prison Experiment and could not be a real experiment is not important here. The same underlying principles at work could give this outcome and the movie makes that painstakingly clear. Slowly the guards and prisoners dehumanize each other; rules set out are broken; violence used when forbidden; leadership taken on and taken over; one person (the journo!) stirring at all. Some have noted here that the whole process goes a little fast, but there are some big time lapses in the movie. The military man Steinhoff seems the only one early acknowledging the forces at work here, as he has gone through it all in his military training and service. It makes perfectly clear how rapidly personal frustration leads to Nazi-like behavior.This is also somewhat convenient for Germans (Serbs, etc.) facing their recent history, as there is a rational explanation for war crimes and we can all sleep comfortably now. Of course other forces (political, cultural and social) are at work to create the circumstances and while serving as an explanation, there is always individual responsibility. A good idea would therefore have been to show part of the trials in one way or another.Using the thriller-format is a good choice, because it keeps the audience on board to convey a deeper message. The limited budget and Hirschbiegel's background as director of TV-movies shines through with a completely redundant love interest, a very slow start and some camera-work from TV-land. But once the experiment starts, there is also the restriction of space present where these problems shift to the background. And the story itself is so compelling you will soon forget about the cinematic restrictions. This is also very well paced and seen on a stand-alone basis a very good thriller anyway.This is extremely powerful stuff. It is shocking and most viewers will probably be thinking about this some weeks after the experience.</td><td>rw1134414</td><td>Confronting the past</td><td>diand_</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(19, 26)</td><td>Revolt of the Zombies (1936)</td><td>2</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>\"This might mean the end of the white race!\" gasps a general as a dozen Native Zombies wander around the battlefields of Europe during the \"Great War\". An expedition sets out tor the long-lost, back-projected city of Kennif-Angor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent honest white people to slaughter each other by the tens of thousands.It is a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as the acting is so wooden. Even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is bad. From a previous decade. It looks like it came out of a correspondence school text book on 'How to Act' ------------- Chapter Three: Emotions -------------\"How to express fear and loathing (Female) Clench both fists. Place fist of one hand on heart. Open mouth as it to scream. Place other fist, palm out, against mouth. Hold pose for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable then quickly turn head 90 degrees away from direction of loathed object and sob\".\"How to have difficult, heavily emotionally charged scene with ex-fiancé explaining your love for someone else. Do NOT make eye contact. Do not move. Do not show any emotion. Do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines off the studio wall.\" To give us a respite from the leaden acting the director cunningly cuts in long pauses where nothing much happens except that film keeps running through the projectors. Thus 35 minute's worth of story is padded out to 60ish minutes.The revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow! Released from mental bondage the armies of ex-zombiefied minions turn on their former master by ambling slowly up hill and then sort of stabbing a door a bit and smashing a window. \"Yea... let's... oh, I dunnno yeah. Let's get him grrr. Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana.\" (though I have just found a bit of hidden symbolism. Jagger is shot by a Native as some sort of ironic counterpoint to all the Natives being shot by the Germans at the start of the flick. see, even downtrodden Natives don't want the end of the White Race!) The chase (it you can call it that) through the back-projected swamp is hilarious and worth the admission price alone. Roy D'Arcy has a hell of a time camping it up, but is totally wasted, as Col. Mazovia.There is one interesting moment in this film. A nice little montage of the zombied natives and white cast members falling under the evil eyes spell. face after face, cross-fade into one another. It works, though there is a strange little blip in the middle of each close up like a frame has been cut.

They were 18 or 19 tops and came in hand in hand. She looked as wholesome as Laura Ingalls and he looked like he could have come straight from choir practice. He held down the seat for her and then offered to go out for popcorn or a drink if she so desired. They seemed as innocent and as pure a couple as I had seen a young pair in some time.This was going to be good.The Devil's Rejects doesn't take long to reveal the type of film to which the next 90 or so minutes will be spent. A towering creature of a man with a bag over his head carries a fully naked dead woman by the feet through the woods. Before the opening credits are revealed, there is a stabbing, a scene where the living lay in rest next to the naked bodies of the dead, multiple images of dead corpses in various stages of decay and a police shootout that leaves a few cops on the wrong side of living.We were now only a few minutes into the film and already I was having just as much fun watching the reactions of the two in front of me as I was savoring the gratuitous violence displayed on the large screen. He looked to be somewhat enjoying himself, while she was definitely not amused. More on them later.The Devil's Rejects follows the violent exploits of the Firefly family. They are a murderous family that are responsible for countless disappearances and deaths in the Texas area. But when the Texas Rangers lead by Sheriff Wydell lead a raid on the House of Corpses, Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sherri Moon) and clown faced Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) go on the run leaving a trail of blood and bodies from film set to film set.The fist stop is at a run down motel where two unsuspecting couples become hostages for Otis and Baby. Their encounter is both obscene and disturbing and anyone who knows Rob Zombie knows that the ending to their ordeal will not be pleasant. Some are shot, all are humiliated and what the final survivor is subjected to is that of NC-17 and X-rated thinking.It was here that the girl sitting in front of me left for the first time. I could tell since she didn't whisper over to her mate that she was going to the washroom, or grabbing a drink, that it was just too much for her at that time. I was distracted from the film somewhat as I was trying to keep an eye both on the action unfolding and the reaction of the young man. Would he leave too? Is he wondering where she might be? He actually looked confused about her departure. Not concerned mind you, but concerned.She returned about 10 minutes later. Didn't ask what had transpired in her absence and continued to watch the film as if a fresh air break was an essential requirement. The next scene took the evading Firefly family to a whorehouse community where they met up with king pimp Charlie (Ken Foree). Drugs, partying and sex ensue, so I again was distracted by the youngins.She now showed all the signs of someone who was incredibly uncomfortable and ready to leave at any time. She held her head against her fist. She ran her fingers through her hair with every bloodsplat and she would shake her head side to side in a disagreeing fashion as the violence continued to escalate.By the time Sheriff Wydell hires two thugs to help capture the family so that he could take them back to their home (yeah, that makes sense) and inflict his own brand of justice, she had reached the end of her tether and walked out for now the third time. As the final shoot-out ensued, she came back, took the hand of the young man who I am guessing picked the film of viewing that evening and walked out.The above story is exactly whey I can't recommend The Devil's Rejects. Although the film pays homage to the drive in movies and low budget horror flicks of the seventies, it just doesn't fit in circa 2005. Also known as House of 1000 Corpses 2, this was Rob Zombie's second stab at terrorizing those brave enough to pay for his efforts. House of 1000 Corpses ended up on my worst of list a few years back and although The Devil's Rejects doesn't get my validation, it is a step up from his previous attempt. The only problem is that the step up lead to a step out the aisle and countless steps towards the car in what has to be the worst date movie choice since I brought my fiancée to see Thelma & Louise while trying to make up for a fight.</td><td>rw1134417</td><td>A bloodbath of brutality - not your ideal date movie</td><td>gregsrants</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 9)</td><td>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>Well.I've heard so many bad remarks about this movie.so I'm gunna say what i think.

I recently bought the DVD, and I've watched it several times since. Okay, it's not exactly realistic, but it's not intended to be. That's the whole point, so don't be afraid to indulge!!! It really takes you back to your teen years, especially if you ever babysat and wished for some excitement instead of boredom. Chris Parker (a marvellous Elisabeth Shue) is a beautiful high school senior who was anticipating celebrating with her boyfriend, Mike (Bradley Whitford) regarding their anniversary. However, the jerk (as the viewers know) stands her up with some really lame excuse and she ends up babysitting for the Andersons, who have a very curious and adorable daughter, Sara, (Maia Brewton) and a teenage son, Brad, (Keith Coogan, grandson of the great Jackie Coogan) who secretly makes puppy eyes at Chris. Brad's obnoxious best friend, Daryl (Anthony Rapp) shows up and wants in when Chris receives a frantic phone call from her best friend, Brenda (a wonderfully comedic Penelope Ann Miller), who has run away from home, only to be stranded at a downtown Chicago bus stations with some really pricelessly goofy characters. Our heroine dares to take the rugrats with her to rescue her pal, and they encounter one outrageous adventure after another. In the process, they blow a tire, meet up with an amputee truck driver, witness an assault, end up being dragged down to a automobile heisting operation, chased by the bad guys, singing in a blues club (one of the best sequences), come between a gang war on a subway, crash (almost literally) a frat party, and discover that Chris's guy has been two-timing her with an \"easy chick\", and end up at the Anderson's party downtown. And they do, finally accomplish their mission to rescue Brenda, while trying to beat the progenetors home!!! Whew!!! No wonder Chris decides that this is going to be her first and last job!!!! The 60s soundtrack does nothing to hurt the film, in fact, it enhances it, especially the opening track, \"He Kissed Me\" by the Crystals. (A moment that every girl dreams about). The situations are hilarious, with as always, the charmingly clueless yuppie parents, funny villains, and resourceful protagonists.

Sorry - claiming to be related to Aunt Nellie and Uncle Ed, or whatever, would never, ever get them to the villa or on the yachts. Once identified, the Secretary - and his daughters - would never have allowed them to marry these two grifters. I don't care how egalitarian we pretend to be - it would never occur.

The use of vertical angles as a visual motif, and the love affair that Boorman's camera has with the architecture and settings throughout the film can clearly be seen in later works by directors as diverse as Quentin Tarantino and Jim Cameron. Los Angeles becomes a character under Boorman's skilled stewardship, here closing in on Marvin and his enemies with the stark diagonal planes of the LA river basin storm drains, there opening up the world as Marvin stalks the Hollywood hills with the city laid out beyond him in magnificent, eye-popping clarity.The story is one of passion, treachery, and revenge; the mechanics of the story are implicit not only in the spare, at times near-impressionistic dialogue, but in the stunning visuals Boorman's camera utilizes. From the acid-trip grooviness of the backstage nightclub battle, with the action reflected and commented on by the models' faces cast huge on a projected screen, to the splashes of psychedelic colour on Marvin's face at the conclusion of the scene, colour, lighting and angles are counted on to carry so much of this story -- and they bear the burden well.I don't know if Patrick McGoohan was thinking of this film when he created The Prisoner, but fans of that series will also see echoes on the screen, in the way each scene is colour-coded across the board. On the commentary track, Boorman talks at length about his theories of colour in relation to the film, and it's a lesson with strong practical applications for anyone working with colour, in movies, comics, or any artform.Point Blank is a movie I know I will be returning to again and again, to relish Marvin's primal scenery-chewing presence, and to bask in the glow of Boorman's vivid colour choices, so wonderfully recaptured on this DVD. If you want to tell stories, or if you just enjoy them being told to you well and with a challenging wit and intelligence, Point Blank is absolutely indispensable viewing.</td><td>rw1134421</td><td>Indispensable, Rock-Hard Neo Noir</td><td>alandaviddoane</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(14, 23)</td><td>Torque (2004)</td><td>10</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>if they just cut out saying 'bitch' a few times i would give it a ten. the plot is shakespearian. the dialog is really corny but the film makes fun of its own dialog via the relationship between the 2 lead characters. the fbi cop is amazingly cast and so his his side kick. he is like some starbucks sarcastic teenager who got a hummer for his birthday.the visuals, though, are what make this movie. they are absolutely crazy. even with the matrix and all the other movies like it, the visuals in this film are still quite something to see. they have unusual angle changes, strange lighting, atmospheric effects, zooms, low angles of motorcycle chases, etc. there are numerous times where a 0.5 second frame is injected in a really weird manner that is quite striking, such as when the woman pushes the trigger on the explosives, or when the bike rider flips up her knife in slow motion and catches it. the shot of ice cube looking at 'ford' through the train is also quite striking.the stunts are incredible ... the product placement is completely over the top and obvious in a really silly way, but somehow it fits with the movie, because the movie is over the top in a really silly way too. and motorcyclers and racers really do have corporate logos pasted all over their bodies so it doesn't seem ridiculous.the evil woman reminds me of a Disney villain from Cinderella or something. if you stop trying to analyze everything so much you just might have a jolly good time eating popcorn as you watch the explosions and motorbikes flying all over the screen.</td><td>rw1134422</td><td>this movie is completely ridiculous, but i love it -spoiler-</td><td>fliphop</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(27, 28)</td><td>All That I Need (2005)</td><td>9</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>The audience gets to play proverbial fly on wall at the posh \"meetings\" and one helluva grand finale of the pyramid, Muffin Club.

We all know what Thunderball is about (and frankly, if you are going to do a remake of a bond movie, you can do a lot better than thunderball!). The villain was absolutely weak. If you try to compare him to zorin, khan, drax, Stromberg, then you are nuts. His henchman (or in this case, henchwoman) carrera was decent but nowhere in the same galaxy as jaws, mayday, or Gobinda. And that cheesy video game they played, that was such a copycat of octopussy where bond played kamal khan in backgammon and surprised the villain in a winner take all match (this movie was both filmed and released after octopussy). I don't even know how bond could have figured out how to play it in 2 minutes.But the worst part of all? After watching this stinker for over 90 minutes, I would pray it would end, that this joke of a movie would end, but it goes on for over 2 hours!!!

It's just the sort of story I really would like to see more in Dutch films, and not in the way Johan Nijenhuis does it. A story with real emotions, and where people turn out really different than you think they are for real. Eef here for example, the homophobic who turns out to be gay himself. You don't see that kind of stuff in 'Volle Maan'. The things I really don't like about this is, most of all, the really childish humor in this film, like at the gas station where Eef asks a girl 'Shall I put that in?' (Zal ik m er even insteken).

Even though TCM gave it 1.5 out of 4 stars, I just couldn't resist a 1931 pre-Code with handsome Ramon Navarro, so I gave it a whirl.Handsome Austrian lieutenant Willi (Navarro) meets virgin music instructor Laura (Helen Chandler), pursues her, gets her drunk, spends the night with her. She's in love, but he thinks it was just fun and games. He leaves her 100 gilder on the breakfast table. (Note to pre-Code fellas: when you spend the night with an innocent girl, don't leave her money in the morning; you will only insult her and turn her into a prostitute for real as she wreaks revenge on you while feeling she's good for nothing else now that you've defiled her -- Freddie March made the same mistake in 1934's \"We Live Again\" -- tsk tsk).Her heart hardened, Laura calls up Herr Schnabel (Jean Hersholt), a rich brute of a man whom Willi previously saved Laura from. In front of Willi, Laura tells Herr S. that she's \"willing to accept your previous invitation ... and quite completely.\" We get the drift; Laura becomes Herr S.'s mistress and is transformed from shabbily dressed music instructor to kept woman in fancy new apartment with a new wardrobe and dripping in diamond jewelry.Willi truly does seem to love Laura, and wants to make amends for ruining her life. Laura tells Willi that if he has more money than Herr S., that she will go with him. Willi plays chemin-de-fer (baccarat) with Herr S., but loses 14,000 gilder to him, which he must pay by noon the following day. As he leaves the casino, Laura gives Willi her address; he is waiting in her apartment when she arrives home. They kiss, and Laura tells Willi this is now \"Act 2\". They spend the night together, and in the morning she is now the one who is leaving money for him. She tells him over breakfast: \"I'm a businesswoman now... You taught me how to make love without meaning a word that I say. I amused you once, and you paid me. Well, you're as handsome as ever and just as amusing. I return the compliment,\" as she reveals the money she's hidden under his breakfast plate.Willi, determined to prove his love for Laura, leaves the money there and prepares to pay his debt by committing honor suicide. Willi's rich uncle, unable to bear the thought, offers to pay his debt but only if Willi will marry Emily, a member of a wealthy upper class family. Willi would rather die than marry Emily. Willi offers instead to quit the army, get a regular job, marry the woman he loves, and repay his uncle over time. At first the uncle rebuffs this idea, but in the end accepts rather than see Willi kill himself.Next scene: Laura is teaching music again. Willi interrupts the lesson (as he did the first night he met Laura), some code words are exchanged (student's mother to Willi: Where's your uniform?, Willi's reply as he looks at Laura not the mother: I'm going to a masquerade, as a human being). Willi and Laura kiss. The End.This movie also had some hilarious moments to it, if I may continue on with the spoilage: 1 - Willi's manservant Josef, who loves to parade around Willi's apartment wearing Willi's underwear; and who, when kicked in the rump from Willi for burning him with a hot towel, says \"Thank you sir.\" He seemed to enjoy that kick! 2 - Willi hanging out with a prostitute at a fancy bar, Herr Schnable walks by and tells him, \"Hope you wouldn't do anything I wouldn't do\", to which Willi replies slyly with a slight raise of one eyebrow, \"We're going to do something you *couldn't* do!\" 3 - Willi donning his hat and checking himself out in the mirror after spending the first night with Laura; he tells his reflection \"Just as handsome as ever!\" 4 - The music student's parents believe Willi to be Laura's cousin. When Willi and Laura are kissing passionately at the end of the movie, the parents look on smiling but then, realizing \"oh hey, aren't they cousins?\" they turn and give each other a puzzled \"what the hell????\" kind of look. It was pretty darned funny actually.Sometimes these 1- or 1.5-star flicks on TCM are duds, sometimes they are enjoyable little trifles such as this.

Amitabh Bachhan was his usual best, and as was Sharmila Tagore. The part where Amar(John Abraham) is shot, is, i feel, the best bit of the film. Another minus of the film was the ending, it was poor, it shows him warping away, as though back to his home planet. Overall, good film to keep you occupied for 2-3 hours.

That is why this is such a great film. We can all relate to LaMotta. We have all had our ups and downs. Then again, just cause something goes down doesn't mean it can't go up again. That's what LaMotta experienced with the making of this movie.The film features great performances by Robert De Niro (who won an Oscar for this film) and Joe Pesci.

These individuals also tend to criticize everything to the outmost detail and tend to forget that these are ONLY MOVIES!(ii) Lucas Geeks who worship the man and will give all his movies 10 star ratings, even if the movie was a lump of crap sitting there stinking it up attracting flies for 2 hours (and let me tell you this movie is not far off!). There is a third segment of us, that while being die-hard fans of the first three movies still are willing to give the second trilogy a chance, but are critical of what we see as mediocre attempts to relive a great trilogy.I consider myself part of number 3, which you will see in my reviews of all the Star Wars movies. I have Sith 7 stars, this 1 and will give clones 4 when my reviews are finished on this trilogy. Phantom Menace is half C Span and half kiddy movie. I have found it unwatchable and can't get through it a second time. Jake Lloyd can't act and it would have added to the plot to make Anakin 5-10 years older. I do not wish to insult those who like the movies, however, i do not see how you can enjoy them unless you are under the age of 11.The movie's plot is difficult to figure out. It is over some sort of blockade by the trade federation over the planet Naboo. If they have a problem why don't they just slap some tariffs on Naboo and let it be. Anyhow, there are the usual chases and star wars effects, none of which seem to work. The underwater chase especially is very boring. The pod race is a little better.Jar Jar, is some kind of drunken retarded sports' mascot. And Darth Maul is pathetic, he has all the elements of a bad guy on the surface, but is on screen for about 10 minutes and has little to no dialogue. Even the Emperor's \"Wipe them all out\" line is laughable considering he is using a bunch of second rate droids to do so and doing it over a trade dispute. In the end Anakin blows up the lead ship up, almost through dumb luck, there is some sort of mental celebration, Qui Gon dies and we are set up with Obi Won training Anakin in the next movie.

The original Vacation is the best, although Christmas Vacation gave it a good run for its money. Both films are incredibly dated, but it is the savage lack of restraint or political correctness in the original that makes it worth repeat viewings. 1983 was a great year for comedies that were unafraid of being labelled as being in bad taste, and director Harold Ramis had already proved his mettle on Caddyshack, one of the finest films ever made about golf. Paired with such fine actors as Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid, there was precious little that could go wrong here. When it does go wrong, the audience is too busy laughing at the other ninety nine instances where the cast and crew get it right to care. Unlike many other comedies where jokes are deleted because they didn't test well, Vacation simply leaves the failures behind and moves on to the next.The plot concerns itself with one Clark Griswold, a designer of food additives who wishes people would take him more seriously. He takes his family on a road trip across the USA, with the final destination being a theme park known as Wallyworld. Wallyworld being a cheap knock-off of Disneyland, naturally. None of the film is really rooted in reality, as the moment when the old Griswold family car is ceremoniously towed off to be crushed at the car dealership. Maybe it is meant to demonstrate how spineless a man Clark is, but even the most timid man would file complaints or sue if the vehicle he ordered turned out to not be there on the delivery date, and his old car was written off. Clark's spinelessness is a two-edged sword. It drives the comedy very effectively in some scenes, but it grates in others. As I have more or less indicated, it only works when there is no good reason for him to be more aggressive.The plot thread with Clark lusting after a babe in a Ferarri (that is more or less how she is billed) is incredibly dated nowadays. Christie Brinkley puts in a great performance as the piece of tail that this spineless wimp keeps chasing in spite of the fact that he should know this woman is so out of his league. Dana Barron and Anthony Michael Hall are great as the long-suffering Griswold children, who alternate between being amused at the misadventures on the road and reflecting on what a big wuss their father is. Observant viewers will noticed that Anthony Michael Hall grows a foot or two between the introductory sequences and the arrival at the Griswolds' destination. John Candy gets a great cameo as a security guard who seems as spineless as Clark. But it is Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Jane Krakowski, John Navin, and Imogene Coca as Ellen's relatives who make the film as funny as people remember. One almost wishes there could be a film entirely devoted to these idiots.For sure, Vacation is incredibly dated, and some of the humour in it has been lost to time. It has also spawned more sequels than any franchise this ordinary deserves. Then again, you could not have Christmas Vacation without European Vacation, so I guess we should take the good with the bad. Anthony Michael Hall has defied expectations and had a decent career since, while Dana Barron and most of the rest of the cast have seemingly dropped off the face of the Earth. Chevy Chase has basically been reduced to the B-list, making the kind of films that rarely get released on video outside of America, if at all. Fortunately, director Harold Ramis has gone onto much bigger and better things, as an actor, director, and a writer. Unfortunately, this kind of B-level comedy that used to fill the rental shelves has been phased out in favour of politically correct drivel. I guess some you win, some you lose.I gave Vacation a six out of ten. Unlike some other comedies that have \"this is a product of the 1980s\" stamped all over them, it has not aged well. It is, in fact, quite a step down from Caddyshack, Chevy Chase's previous collaboration with Harold Ramis. Still, if you are bored and could do with some nostalgia, Vacation might be worth a try.</td><td>rw1134434</td><td>1980s B-grade comedy at its most... average</td><td>mentalcritic</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(3, 4)</td><td>Embrace the Darkness 3 (2002 Video)</td><td>null</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*A sexy vampire decides she's had enough of her boring vampire lover and makes him hit the road.

His name is synonymous with many things, including a campaign to get people to have regular visits with the optometrist (a popular poster in optometrist offices began with the headline \"Ray Charles should not be blind\"). Throughout his life, he projected the image of a man who should be loved, in spite of some very serious character flaws. Children of the era I grew up in knew him mainly as an eccentric musician who, in spite of being as blind as a bat, was more full of life than many people who were in full possession of all their senses. Ray as a film tries to uphold that image that many of us have of the man, but it also digs deeper to produce the story of a man who lived with many demons, and thus was not necessarily a saint. Some would call it blasphemy to show Ray Charles as a womanising drug addict, but in doing so, the film goes to its glory.The film covers the period from when Ray Charles began what would eventfully become an illustrious career as a musician to the time he kicked a heroin habit. A few details outside of this period are added in the form of flashbacks, usually to explain some of the more peculiar details of his character. For example, when we are told that Ray never used a cane or a guide dog, we get a flashback of his mother, played with an obvious enthusiasm by Sharon Warren, teaching him how to pay more attention to his surroundings, using the audio cues to guide him. The scenes with a young Ray, played by C.J. Sanders, slowly going blind from glaucoma, are almost enough to bring tears to the eyes. In playing the adult Ray, Jamie Foxx wore eye prosthetics that really left him blind during much of the principal photography. A small detail that might seem, but this kind of dedication to one's art is admirable, and it shows throughout the film.The film is a study in the two addictions that dominated Ray Charles' life. Early on in the film, the aforementioned mother makes him promise that he will not live like a cripple, as she more or less puts it. Physically, he keeps his promise, but it is the emotional side where he falls down, and this becomes obvious as his womanising ways add up to more sticky situations than most of us will have if we live five lifetimes. But it is the heroin addiction that really bookends the film, and it is no coincidence that the film mainly covers the years in which this addiction had a hold of him. Towards the end of the film, as the Ray on film is entering rehabilitation in order to avoid prison, or so the film has it, we get one of the best \"you broke your promise\" scenes I've seen on film in years. From this point, we go to the scene with Georgia rescinding its ban against Ray Charles performing there, and the film succeeds in what most biopics of this nature fail at. Depicting a triumph over adversity without being sappy. Kerry Washington's line says it all: you cannot feel sorry for someone that you respect.I admit it, I am a sucker for stories that depict a human being overcoming adversity. What makes Ray so compelling is that the man in question was very real, and the adversity he overcame was so great. In this day, where governments are imposing more tax upon us than medieval Kings imposed upon serfs, it is scarcely imaginable that there will be others like him anytime soon. Indeed, some disabilities that seriously impair lives can remain undiagnosed for decades, leaving us with stark reminders that for all the social changes that have taken place since the time depicted here, we are still no further forward. Perhaps life is meant to be a struggle, and Ray Charles understood this better than any of us. For 150 minutes, Jamie Foxx does not just play Ray Charles. For all practical purposes, he is Ray Charles for that short span of time. In turn, the film highlights a good reason why governments are now trying to socially engineer us away from music. Music has the power to unite people, to turn the poorest among us into the richest (and I do not mean in monetary terms). Just as Ray Charles exemplified this fact in his lifetime, so too does Ray the film.The only flaw I found in the film was that the actors portraying Ray's supporting musicians were somewhat flat, and the film seemed to die in the last fifteen minutes before Ray's triumph over heroin addiction. For these reasons, I gave the film a nine out of ten. It is not the best film I have ever seen, but it is a fitting tribute to a truly indomitable spirit. It deserves to be seen at least once.</td><td>rw1134436</td><td>A strange look into the life of a truly great man</td><td>mentalcritic</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(9, 11)</td><td>Malibu Eyes (2004 Video)</td><td>null</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* I rented \"Malibu Eyes\" because I thought it was going to be another sex flick. The description sure sounded like it was going to be: Young girl in a beach house spies on her neighbors etc. But I'm afraid \"Malibu Eyes\" has pretensions to be something far more than that. It is trying, and I emphasize trying, to be some sort of thriller in which Hannah watches people and in turn is watched by a mysterious stranger. Were the filmmakers trying to tip us off with the palindrome name HANNAH? Hannah gets it both ways. She watches them, they watch her. I watch all of them and cry all night long. It's a vicious cycle.\"Malibu Eyes\" is a stinker. It's shot on cheap video and looks tacky. What the heck am I watching? More importantly, where's the sex? If Hannah loves watching people, why can't she watch something interesting? Who knew spying in neighbor's windows could be so dull? Hannah even has a secret camera in her sunglasses. So she wanders around the beach looking like one of the ladies from \"Invasion of the Bee Girls\". It's preposterous and pathetic. The real kick in the groin with this one is that any remote semblance of a payoff scene is shot so ineptly that you can't make out what's going on. Any nudity or sex scene is handled badly. The only reason for watching Hannah the voyeur is to see what she sees and she better see something worthwhile. You see? Better yet, don't see this one.

By a different time, I mean a time when the idea of a feature film being digitally photographed was more impressive than it is now. While digital cinematography is still very much in its infancy, filmmakers have already begun to realise that its novelty alone cannot save a film from mediocrity. George Lucas showed this much on Revenge Of The Sith, and Robert Rodriguez made a valiant effort to show he understood this with Once Upon A Time In Mexico. Kerry Conran, on the other hand, demonstrates no understanding of this simple fact on Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow. Much of the film feels like a mish-mash of digital effects, and while there is nothing necessarily wrong with this, it becomes painfully obvious in a hurry that there would be nothing to the film without them.The cast are essentially lost in a sea of effects without a paddle. Sir Lawrence Olivier would cry blasphemy if he knew his image was being stitched into a film like this. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law have all the on-screen chemistry of dead ducks. Neither are really the most capable of actors, but Law did once prove in Enemy At The Gates that he can act when the material is right. Paltrow, on the other hand, proves that the blonde reporter woman archetype of the 1940s era film is probably best forgotten. Angelina Jolie could have saved the film, and the scenes featuring her cool, charming presence do lift the tone when they come, but her role is little more than an extended cameo. It is not as perfunctory as Christopher Lee's walk-on during Revenge Of The Sith, but one could have erased her from this turkey without making the slightest dent. But that would also entail eliminating the only actor who displays any range. At least she reacts differently to massive flying machines trying to shoot her down, compared to a meeting with an old friend.The plot, such as it is, features machines of various design attacking such locations as New York City, and disappearing into parts unknown. The titular Captain of the piece leads a group of mercenaries who are charged with the task of tracking them down and doing whatever they deem necessary to stop future attacks. At one point, he is assisted in this by a Captain of the Navy who sounds more like she ought to be in porn films. The plot is set in motion by pasted footage of Lawrence Olivier explaining a mad plot to kidnap a handful of scientists from around the world. For purposes that, when explained towards the end, really reduce this film to little more than a James Bond prequel. That is all one really needs to know about the film, and by the time the film is over, that is all that anyone really does know. The dialogue is not so much delivered as it is recited, and the actors make it patently clear at all points that they are reacting to nothing. True, it is a challenge to act for something that will be pasted in later, but after Ian McKellen did such a smashing job of it in the one good Lord Of The Rings film, excusing actors on this basis is no longer \"on\", so to speak.And that is basically where it all falls down. People have criticised two of the Star Wars prequels for being nothing but a hundred million dollars worth of special effects in search of a plot. What they do not realise is that in spite of threadbare writing, these two films at least gave us characters we could care about. In spite of a plot more complicated than it really needs to be, and the fact that I knew the outcome before it began, I ground my teeth together during every step of Obi-Wan Kenobi's frenetic battle with Darth Maul. In spite of the fact that it had all the supporting drama of a tennis ball. This, friends and neighbours, is because the character had personality and charisma in his own limited way. Once Angelina Jolie is out of the picture, Sky Captain gives itself nothing to hang itself on. Jude Law has lost the ability to carry a feature film on his shoulders, and Gwyneth Paltrow never had it to begin with. Roger Ebert compares this film with Indiana Jones, which is one of the most misplaced comparisons I have ever heard of. I gave a damn about Indiana Jones. In fact, I gave more than a damn, because Indiana Jones in all of its iterations so far have been some of the greatest adventure films ever made. Sky Captain is a minor twitch of the cheek by comparison.Because of a total lack of emotional investment or interest I had in the film from beginning to end, I rated it a two out of ten. If it had been bad enough to be entertaining, that would have at least been something. I therefore have no qualms about saying that Ed Wood could direct a better film than Kerry Conran.</td><td>rw1134438</td><td>Ho hum</td><td>mentalcritic</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(36, 53)</td><td>Wild Things: Diamonds in the Rough (2005 Video)</td><td>1</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>One really has to feel for Dina Meyer as she struggles through this C-level production. The law of diminishing returns pretty much states that the more one tries to repeat an accomplishment or action, the less successful the results will be. Most film franchises conform to this rule faithfully, with the latter episodes in the Police Academy or Aliens series managing to plumb depths in their respective genres that used to keep television programmers well-stocked for early-morning material. There are also exceptional sequels, the second Star Trek or X-Men films being good examples. The third Wild Things film is the same thing to late franchise entries as Police Academy: Mission To Moscow. The most telling sign of the third Wild Things film being crap is that it did not even receive so much as a direct to video release. This was filmed with cable, or even free to air, television in mind. My guess would be one of those hotel cable channels where they screen not-quite-porn for desperate customers who have nothing better to watch.Like the previous two Wild Things films, Diamonds In The Rough attempts to create a twisting and turning plot for the titillation of the viewer. While Wild Things 2 succeeded by completely recycling the plot of the highly entertaining original, Diamonds In The Rough attempts to recreate the mild revival of the erotic thriller without resorting to recycling the screenplay or screen composition of the original. Calling it moderately, or even mildly, successful would be flattering. Diamonds In The Rough is a failure thanks in no small part to a pace that is so rushed it feels incoherent. An attempt to recreate the threesome scene is made, and it has the virtue of both women getting naked in front of the camera, but it goes by so quickly that viewers are often hard-pressed to remember anything about it mere minutes after viewing. Sandra McCoy apparently suffered a fifty-percent pay cut for hiring a body double in this film. That should summarise how much dedication to one's art this film inspires.Dina Meyer essentially jumps into the role played by Terence Bridge in the previous film, and by Kevin Bacon in the one before that. She is about the only person in this film who can act, and the screenplay does a good job of obscuring this. The dialogue is not exactly daft, but it really only fills space while we wait for the next display of flesh. In Wild Things, the plot was coherent and even intriguing without the little tidbits displayed during the end credits. Wild Things 2 is neither here nor there, since both the main plot and the tidbits are more or less entirely lifted from Wild Things. Diamonds In The Rough's main plot and tidbits were not written by an army of monkeys seated in front of an army of typewriters. It was vomited out by a bunch of crack-addled monkeys who bashed their heads into the keys of a bunch of typewriters for a year.My summary says it all, really. I watched Diamonds In The Rough for over an hour, even making mental notes as something particularly stupid took place. I cannot remember a singular detail of the threadbare plot, save for something to do with Dina Meyer's character being a parole officer with a personal mission. Of course, there is the usual stuff about two characters having a complex interplay relationship that turns out to be a shady criminal conspiracy. There is simply not enough screen time in this film to give this element proper development. About the only satisfactory continuance in the film comes when a line is repeated. Plot tangents are mentioned in one second, dropped like a stone in the next, and then resumed a reel or three later with not the slightest bit of linking. Perhaps it was deliberately designed to cause viewers to lose millions of brain cells in the memory area. Perhaps the film is simply so bland or stupid that, like the production of RoboCop, the mind just blanks it out like a violent crime. As I said earlier, however, it is less than a day since I watched Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough, and I am absolutely stumped when trying to recall something memorable about it.Out of ten, I gave Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough a one. It is bad enough that one could show it to people they want information or cooperation out of. After the first viewing, one is in a mildly uncomfortable mood. About halfway through the second viewing, that cyanide capsule starts to look mighty tempting.</td><td>rw1134439</td><td>So bad it could be used as a weapon of mass destruction</td><td>mentalcritic</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(21, 32)</td><td>I Spit on Your Grave (1978)</td><td>null</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* \"I Spit on your Grave\" is the greatest rape and revenge flick ever made. It is brutal, powerful, sleazy and exploitative. It is also quite effective and will probably leave scars on you. Obviously, it's a must see.A female writer goes out into the woods to get some work done. Four locals start checking her out and decide they want more. Now, at this point you are expecting a rape scene. You know its coming. So the locals take her in the grass and have their way with her. It's not a very graphic rape. I was expecting to be shocked but I wasn't. It was at this point that the movie really began. As the writer walks away, she is pounced on and raped a second time. This scene was brutal. There is no music or editing done on the rape scene. It is shot as if you are really there watching it happen. She is pinned down on a rock and screams for her life. Does the movie want you to enjoy what you're seeing or would it rather have you be disgusted at the sexual violence? I don't know. I would imagine it wants it both ways. Horror fans will probably love the thrill of being shocked while others will be repulsed.What really takes \"I Spit on your Grave\" over the top is the next rape scene. Yes, she's raped a third time. She crawls back to her house and is violated again. Now we know that these men are cretins and deserve everything they've got coming to them. The rest of the movie has the writer dishing out bloody death to the lecherous men. She knows the power her body has over them and decides to use it so that she can spit on their graves.I found this movie to be a brutal gut punch. The rape scenes were tough to watch. \"I Spit on your Grave\" is not just some cheap horror flick. It is undeniably shocking and well made.

I would love to see a straight up the middle vampire movie again. \"Fright Night\" is a good example of an entertaining vampire movie. \"Dracula III\" is another in a long line of goofy vampire slayer movies that bite off more than they can chew.So a vampire slayer goes to Romania with his annoying sidekick. They are there to look for a lost girl and kill Dracula. Apparently Dracula is trying to take over the entire country! There is a whole rebel army trying to wipe him out. So our slayers wander around the countryside, killing vampires when they can, until they stumble upon Dracula's lair. Could he be staying at the big scary castle which is the only thing that exists at the end of the only road out of town? Possibly.\"Dracula III\" has some good points. There's some decent blood and gore, a few cool fight scenes and a particularly sleazy blood sucking party at Dracula's pad. I guess Dracula's ladies would rather suck each other's blood than have to actually go out and get some themselves.But \"Dracula III\" is so relentlessly stupid and edited so badly that I started to lose interest in it by the fifteen minute mark. While I've never seen a vampire attack somebody while wearing a mask and walking on stilts, I still have to wonder why a vampire would think that that's a good idea. He wouldn't of course but the filmmakers thought it would look cool. That sums up \"Dracula III\". It's a collection of random vampire scenes that were stapled together to give the illusion of a coherent movie.

The only trace of the actual book that has overtaken their determination to tribute it's first movie incarnation is the change of the Martian machines from flying lampshade type things to actual tripods. Other then that the entire film is just an attempt to put a marginally different perspective on the 50's version.To be fair, it does start out well (and there are some good cinematic moments throughout). Some claim it continues well for about 2/3rds of the film, but I think in truth it is only the first 3rd that works at all. It doesn't take long for clichés and overly predictable plot elements to creep in and there is nothing daring or risky about anything attempted by Spielberg after about 20 minutes in. It's all very well for people to go on about the focus on the main Character. But I don't think that is particularly groundbreaking. There are a good number of other directors I think can bring off a personal perspective much better so I don't think Spielberg is even playing to his strengths on this one.Plus, when you have an astronomical budget, one major star and material a good 80% of the audience will already know pretty well (anyone not know how it was going to end?), it pretty much goes without saying that people are going to want to see a lot more of the invading martians. It's all very well to point to the rules of good horror and claim not seeing stuff is suspenseful but is it entirely appropriate for this particular film? I would say not. If Spielberg wanted to do a film like that, why not come up with something fresh rather then doing a remake of a well known film based on a well known book. When you already know what is going on, there is nothing gained by not showing it.The film didn't need to worry about action clichés as in actual fact this film should never have been an action film. Humanity can't defend against these invaders, so why show anything but futility. Perhaps because that wouldn't be very Hollywood, and for all the good intentions of the film it descended into pretty standard action by the end anyway.What I would have liked to have seen would have been more dramatic spectacles, barren landscapes, shocking scenes of destruction, etc. More of the martians and perhaps show how the governments totally failed to stop them with everything they tried. They actually achieved that in the 40's film, so one of the things Spielberg did leave out was the one aspect that really gave the \"not killed by man\" aspect. As a result the very end leaves you cold, and as a big slap in the face to the book they include a voice over copied directly from the 50's film putting everything in a religious point of view (the one thing that really let down the 40's film). The book was to a large extent very anti-religious and there was no need to ignore that very important aspect of the original story. It's not even comfortably put on the end, because with the (totally unnecessary) heroic triumphs achieved by Cruise minutes early it seems like we've suddenly cut to the end of a different film.Perhaps the influence of the 50's film was too much for him. After all, anyone ever notice how similar ET looks to the aliens in the 50's film? If you were to take those aliens and make them cute, you'd end up with ET. Certainly not a co-incidence. This is very much Spielberg remaking what must have been his favourite film.One thing with Spielberg I always found annoying is his obsession with getting certificates that let kids see the film. For a start no other director could release films like this and like Jurassic park (where someones arm is ripped off his body) and get such family orientated ratings. But even with his ability to manipulate censors, he still has to hold back from making what the film should have been just for the sake of letting the kiddies see it. I guess at the end of the day it's all about money and ego and not just about making a really good film.So there you go. I gave this a disappointing 4 out of 10. It had a lot of potential but there are so many flaws and so many mixed up ideas that are never fully realised I just couldn't give it a good score. I couldn't even give it an average score, because with Spielberg, Cruise and the special effects budget I have to compare it to what I think should have been possible with the money spent and talent involved. This film is one of the great underachiever of the modern day. Compare that to the 50's film, which for the time period had stunning effects, a compelling plot and flaws that were all to understandable given the time of filming. It way ahead of it's time and is still a reasonable watch even five decades later.

A Tribute to The Hard Way and to Patrick McGoohan.Since happening upon this film a few years ago  when I managed to win it at auction for just a few pounds - I have become so obsessed with it that I have made pilgrimages all over Ireland in order to pay homage to it, and to its leading actor, Patrick McGoohan. He is, sadly, no longer with us, along with many of the other fine actors who make up the supporting cast (Lee Van Cleef; Donal McCann; Peter Brayham; Joe Lynch). The re-release of the film on DVD, almost 30 years to the day of its original screening, is long overdue  but better late than never! It may have taken a very long time but the best things in life are always worth waiting for.In writing this review, I have struggled long and hard to articulate my feelings into words. I hope that I do justice both to the film and to Patrick McGoohan. I believe that this appearance is arguably his finest, most understated and underrated acting role ever.The plot ambles along; it is heavy and slow; there is hardly any dialogue, and very little action. Anyone looking for a fast moving 'gangster' movie peppered with gunfire (as the trailer included in the DVD's special features seems to suggest) will certainly be disappointed.The use of speech is so sparse it is almost conspicuous by its absence. Most of the scenes are eerily quiet. However, this only serves to build up the tension. The use of body language to convey mood and meaning is very subtly done; especially in the bar room 'stand off' between the two main protagonists. The way in which John Connor (Patrick McGoohan) gently menaces his 'handler' McNeal (Lee Van Cleef), and resists the latter's attempts at persuasion with a quiet, stubborn resolve, is just breathtaking to watch. I can only applaud when the former leaves with quiet dignity, then slams the bar room door behind him to signify, and release, his clearly pent-up anger. That beats any 'shoot out' I've ever seen! In my opinion, Patrick McGoohan's portrayal of the Irish mercenary who wants to retire is extremely sympathetic. He shows a man who is not just a cold-blooded killer. John Connor is very human, and has many redeeming qualities, including that of moral courage  borne out in the parting words of Kathleen (Edna O'Brien), John Connor's estranged wife, in the final scene  \"A waste of a man.\" I have to admit that, in spite of his past deeds, I have to weep for the man  I can't help it. Such is the power of the actor's presence and the skill with which he takes on the mantle of this complex character.In this respect, great credit must also be given to the skillful direction of Michael Dryhurst. Having heard that the actor and the director were very like-minded, I can well believe it when I watch the results.In addition, the stunning cinematography of Henri Decae enhances the production. Sweeping panoramic shots of the Irish countryside and the mountains contrast sharply with the claustrophobic and depressing settings of seedy hotels and dark, dingy city streets. The way the scenes are lit is also very creative and effective.The accompanying soundtrack consists of just three pieces, all of them instrumental, and each is cleverly employed to illustrate the mood of their respective scenes. 'The Dear Irish Boy', an Irish air beautifully rendered by the solo violinist Tommy Potts, and 'Events in Dense Fog,' (from Brian Eno's 'Music for Films') which accompany John Connor's sad, reflective moments, and the forlorn speeches from his estranged wife, tug at the heartstrings and bring tears to the eyes. 'Patrolling Wire Borders,' also from Music for Films (not 'A Measured Room', as is stated on the film credits), is spine-tingling, stark and sinister and is well suited to the more grimly cynical scenes of violence and turmoil in the twilight world of the jaded hit man.Very little is explained to us. There is so much we don't know; for instance, how did a man like John Connor become a mercenary? Why are his children in apparent exile in the States? And why did Kathleen, his estranged wife, then remain behind in Ireland? But somehow, this isn't all that important to know; in fact, it can only add to the appeal of the film. Not being spoon fed such details somehow piques the appetite  and that's partly why I chose not to reveal too much about the plot in this review.To cut a long story short; less is definitely more in this case.

Whether it is Hiroshima, Cambodia, Israel, Afghanistan, or Ground Zero, Velcrow shows us all sides and perspectives while making us \"breathe\" in the pain that all those people felt and still feel. Some of those stories are just astonishingly moving. A man from Sarajewo tells us about snipers that would shoot the rhythm of their national anthem. He knew that after they repeatedly \"played\" their anthem for the third time they would have to recharge their weapons. Those were the seconds he used to \"safely\" cross the street to his home. Some of the stories are not proved to be correct or accurate but they are just amazingly great. One of which is the story of a musician who was told to neither perform nor listen to music any longer. In order to ease his sufferings he started to listen to birds sing instead. After a while his house was full of birds knowing no one could forbid him having birds in his house.

Bunuel makes it appear that the pictures are dirty, as the man tells the girls, \"not to show there parents\". Later we find out the pictures are of monuments and vacation photos, nothing perverse. There's also a dinner party where guests sit on toilets around the table. And who could forget the man at the hotel into kinky S&M? The boy who has relations with his mother?

What he isn't counting on is that he will meet and fall in love with a beautiful and sexy up-and-coming player named Lizzie Bradbury, a turn of events which seems to be having a very positive effect on his game. Soon, he's racking up surprise, come-from-behind wins in the tournament, becoming a major focus of attention for appreciative fans all over Great Britain. The problem is that, as Peter's game improves as a result of the romance, Lizzie's seems to be getting worse, a fact which threatens to put a serious strain on the young couple's burgeoning relationship.Although the story itself is rather innocuous and silly, Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst do achieve a genuine rapport on screen. It's also nice to have a protagonist in a romantic comedy who is not exactly in his physical prime and who is facing some of the rigors of advancing age (he's all of 30, practically his dotage when it comes to professional tennis!). Moreover, the setting is novel and there is just enough of that brittle British humor in the screenplay to keep the film from feeling puerile and canned. It's true that Lizzie seems to be an entirely different person off the court than she is on, but that is just one of those inconsistencies we tend to expect from a movie in which credibility isn't necessarily a prime factor in determining our overall enjoyment of it. And director Richard Loncraine manages to generate some genuine suspense in the final showdown between Peter and the odds-on favorite he isn't expected to beat.\"Wimbledon\" is pure Cinderella romantic fantasy crossed with a David and Goliath, underdog-takes-on-the-reigning-champ sports story.

The loot is then hidden somewhere in the winter quarters of a traveling circus and this leads to a series of brutal killings. Each of the victims is found stabbed with a circus throwing knife. Inspector Elliot (LEO GENN) suspects that one of the circus performers is the killer and the mastermind behind the raid. He has a number of suspects to choose from including the hooded lion tamer Gregor (CHRISTOPHER LEE) who for some mysterious reason is determined to conceal his face.

As the death toll rises, the pressure is on from Sir John (CECIL PARKER), Elliot's superior, to bring the culprit to justice.CIRCUS OF FEAR (not to be confused with the Anton Diffring shocker CIRCUS OF HORRORS) isn't the horror film which it's nudging title promises. It's a disappointingly static murder mystery thriller with mild horrific overtones that wouldn't even scare your five-year-old son! It is based on an Edgar Wallace novel called AND THE THREE JUST MEN (first published in 1928), but the director who made a fine impression with his debut feature (the pseudo-American shocker CITY OF THE DEAD) is clearly uninterested in his material here. Hardly surprising since it's a very shaky plot and he seems happy to just keep the cameras immobile and leave it to the impressive cast to keep the movie afloat.

The film isn't dark or deep enough to be considered along the same lines as the likes of Batman Begins, and at the same time it's not camp or over the top enough to be considered a 'fun' comic book flick. This is one of the main pitfalls for the film, as with this strange placing of the film; it has cut out both of the comic book audiences, and left itself with a film that is as muddled as it's lead actor's acting is weak. The plot seems to jump from one happening to another, often without any kind of explanation or logic. This makes viewing this film a very turgid experience, and the fact that the plotting is so carelessly done has also left the movie a good twenty minutes overlong; which only serves in making the film more painful. It's a shame that this film isn't better, as it has a plot that could have lent itself to a very fun flick. The plot follows John Constantine; a man that can see the demons that live among us. When policewoman Angela Dodson's sister apparently commits suicide, the two team up and discover a conspiracy beneath the surface of their native Los Angeles.Keanu Reeves often gets criticised for his acting, and for good reason - he's rubbish. He slinks his way through the film, giving the very same nonchalant emotion to every scene and event that he comes across. The good thing is that a downtrodden character like John Constantine suits him, so it's not as bad as it could have been...but on the other hand, if a talented actor were given the role; the film would have been much better. Keanu's \"Chain Reaction\" co-star, Racheal Weisz joins him again here, and pretty much does the same thing that he does - i.e. just 'appear'. You don't go into a movie like this expecting good acting really; but this film doesn't have even have 'acting'! The only performance I really enjoyed was Peter Stormare in the role of Satan, and that only lasted about five minutes. The special effects are typically dazzling, and while it's not the best CGI of all time; it's imaginatively used and provides the movie with it's main asset. It's a shame that this film is a flop, as the film noir elements of the plot could really have delivered something interesting, the subject of devils and demons always makes for fun viewing; and the recent run of comic book films has been quite impressive...but impressive, this film is not, and on the whole I recommend giving it a miss.</td><td>rw1134458</td><td>Don't expect this to be another A-quality comic book flick...</td><td>The_Void</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 6)</td><td>The Devil's Rejects (2005)</td><td>5</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>Rob, although many people i know did not like House of 1000 corpses, i loved it, and i waited patiently for this new movie.

My favourite is actually the title song ( instrumental ) which was composed by a certain Alessandro Cicognini, and which appears at various intervals in the film, including in a vocal version sung in Italian with a rhumba rhythm - no one tells us what the title is - so God knows how this can be found. The song \"Tu vuo fa l'americano\" sung by Loren in the nightclub has fared better ! It has actually been sung by one of the artists well known here in France, Dany Brilliant and his version, though not as good as Loren's is not bad at all. As for the other tunes, no sign of them anywhere. Hopefully one day, someone somewhere will have the intelligence to issued the INTEGRAL sound track of this film on a cd.

Once arrived, he meets encounters Sam Hollis and his Indian sidekick, the Karonkawa Indian, Kronk, who are transporting rifles to the town of Moccasin Flats. Don Andrea rescues an Indian maiden, Lonetta, uses Spanish skills to tame longhorns, becomes Sam's rival for Phoebe's affections, heads off a band of angry Comahces and runs continually from the cavalry (who have come to Moccasin Flats to celebrate Texas' statehood but mostly charge after him in gallant groups). At the end of the film, the man Sam calls \"Baldy\" saves the town and also gets his girl--but which one wins him? In this cheerful and frequently hilarious screenplay, Alain Delon is very funny and understated as Don Baldasare, Dean Martin is a bit too-old as Sam Hollis perhaps but shows his excellent comedic timing in the likable role. Rosemary Forsyth is vivacious and very pretty as Phoebe Ann, Southern accent and all; Peter Graves and Andrew Prince lead the cavalry, to whom Graves continually issues orders such as \"To the rur, har!\" which no one understands any more than they can penetrate Kronk's Indian sayings, delivered deadpan and rather beautifully by Joey Bishop.

The story-line of the original play is retained; and it is relatively simple. Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins encounters a colleague from India, Colonel Pickering who has come to see him, on a street outside a major theater. He criticizes a flower-girl's speech, remarking offhandedly that in six months he could her off as a lady--or a shop girl, which requires better English; that it is her accent which keeps her in lower-class poverty. The girl comes the next day, to his home where Higgins is entertaining his new guest, and offers to pay for training. Higgins is a social monster and frightens the girl with his rough talk, but he agrees to take her on, and sends her to his housekeeper to be given a bath and have her clothes burned and replaced--which act turns out to precipitate a major battle... At one point, her ne'er-do-well father, Alfred P. Doolittle, demands money to overlook the Professor's theft of his daughter, Eliza, meaning the income she had provided him; he uses the money to get married. The training proves difficult and arduous; Higgins' mother is amused and frightened by the experiment, set off by Pickering's wagering Higgins could not train the girl. But he does; Eliza proves to be bright, touchy, emotional and altogether more interesting than Higgins had expected. She succeeds, masters an upper-class accent; and then in rapid succession, she is presented at a party to social highbrows where her accent is perfect but the content of her speech is Cockney matters, which they take for a fashionable new court slang, and then she upsets the Ascot Race Meeting crying to the horse she has bet on, \"Move yer bloomin' arse!\", but charms Freddie Eynesford-Hill who becomes her shy suitor. At last the Professor presents her at a a royal ball where she charms everyone concerned, avoids any major faux pas, and convinces a bogus Hungarian phoneticist she must be royal herself. So the experiment has succeeded; Higgins has won his bet. Then he discovers, as a distraught Eliza confronts him the next day, that he has done what he had set out to do--he has created a person capable of self-assertion in the world, but not in the flawed British Empire's stratified and totalitarian society. She leaves him, to marry Freddy; and he discovers he has fallen in love with her. She recognizes that Freddy is unworthy of her and, despite the lack of promises and guarantees from Higgins, returns to do battle with him--for the rest of their lives, perhaps. The entire production looks unarguably lovely, even the Covent Garden faked scene, and a very difficult mixture of faked outdoor and elaborate indoor settings it must have been. Director George Cukor, famed for his skill with actors, gets a near-perfect job of acting from Rex Harrison as Higgins and quite a bit from Audrey Hepburn as Eliza. Others prominent in the large but briefly-seen cast include Theodore Bikel as the Hungarian hairy hound from Budapest, Mona Washbourne as the housekeeper, Isobel Elsom as Mrs Eynesford-Hill, Jeremy Brett as Freddy, Wilfrid Hyde-White as an acceptable Pickering, Stanley Holloway as Papa Dolittle, and Gladys Cooper adequate as Higgins' mother. The screenplay was by Alan Jay Lerner, and the cinematography by Harry Stradling, Sr. The production design and the lovely, colorful art direction must be credited to Cecil Beaton and to Gene Allen in both cases; Beaton also did the fabulously-expensive costumes with Michael Neuwirth. Despite its opulence, the film has consistent style, a very good flow of events and scarcely any look about it of sound-stage claustrophobia, re-hashed stage setting or extraneously-introduced musical numbers. This is a fine late musical achievement from the studio talents that produced of Hollywood's best US musicals, and the most beautiful to watch. It could have been cold and curiously overly-polished; instead it turned out to be a rather genial classic that is genuinely fun to watch in my view, and surprisingly more interesting than one had any right to expect it could be as an on-screen extravaganza.</td><td>rw1134467</td><td>Opulent, Charming and Captivating; A Very-Intelligent Late Musical</td><td>silverscreen888</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(61, 93)</td><td>Wild at Heart (1990)</td><td>10</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>This is one of my favorite David Lynch films. It is also one of the more transparent, easy to understand Lynch films, although that's not the reason why it's one of my favorites. But that fact also makes Wild at Heart a good candidate for introducing someone to Lynch.On the other hand, although it's more transparent and linear on a surface level, I'm still not sure I've figured out the multilayered, bizarre subtexts and symbolism that lie deep beneath the surface--even though I've seen it a few times now. Assuming that there is indeed something to figure out. To an extent, it seems like maybe the hint of something \"deeper\" is in this case more of a red herring. This is one of Lynch's funnier films, albeit very macabre humor. It contains references to all of Lynch's most common \"content quirks\"including sequined ingénues singing jazz, manipulative housewife types, shots of asphalt speeding by, minor characters with freaky speech \"impediments\", severed body parts, and on and on--but it's almost as if he's making fun of himself. Combine that with excellent performances (including a hilarious bit part for Crispin Glover, one of my favorite actors/personalities), a sublimely incongruous score, and a retro, gripping, violent road trip saga cum romance that presages both Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994) and just about all of Quentin Tarantino's career, and you've got quite a film.Wild at Heart, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, is the tale of Sailor (Nicolas Cage) and Lula (Laura Dern), a doe-eyed, \"classy white trash\" couple. As the film starts--and what a start it is--someone tries to stab Sailor to death as he's exiting a theater. Sailor will have none of it, and Lynch begins the film on an exhilarating, brutally violent note--this is not a film for the faint of heart. To complicate matters and set up the primary conflict, we learn even before the attempted stabbing that the hit man was sent by Lula's mother, Marietta Fortune (Diane Ladd), who claimed that Sailor tried to seduce her in the bathroom (this isn't quite true, as we learn in detail later).There isn't a character in the film who isn't involved with some shady business, either presently or in the past. Sailor and Marietta's tensions stem from many years ago, when Lula was just a girl (she's supposedly quite a bit younger than Sailor). The events of the film's opening result in Sailor being imprisoned. Lula dutifully waits for his release, much to the consternation of her mom. The basic gist of the film is disarmingly simple--Sailor and Lula are headed across the country, with an eventual goal of California, as Marietta tries to arrange for Sailor to be put away for good. There are many finely realized subplots and detailed tangents, but that's the crux of the plot on the surface.In addition to his typical hyperreal/surreal weirdness, Lynch concocts a very improbable stew of influences that work together beautifully. Lula has something of an obsession with The Wizard of Oz (1939). She's haunted by visions of the wicked witch (including the \"evil cackle\"), and she sees the road trip as a veritable journey to the Emerald City. Lynch works in a lot of subtle references to The Wizard of Oz with other characters, too. Sailor is something like lounge version of Elvis reincarnated as a gangster flunky, with even better karate moves to match. Yet the two are huge heavy metal fans, especially of a band named \"Powermad\", whose music exquisitely punctuates many sequences, including some sublime dance scenes. In the first half, important scenes are set in New Orleans, with the familiar unsettling undertone that that locale often has in films--you can just smell the voodoo, sex, drugs and death bubbling beneath the skin of the city. Later scenes are set in the desolate, desert prairie country of Texas, which turns out to be even more unsettling (even though I really find such places refreshing and relaxing). There are other kinds of symbolic, stylistic and literal references worked into the film, such as the constant fire motif, which Lynch shoots beautifully, but the above is to just give you an idea of the stew.It all seems like it should add up to some subtextual grand narrative, and maybe it does, but I haven't quite figured out what it all means yet. But it doesn't matter. The stylistic flourishes are ingenious superficially, too, and maybe Lynch _is_ just poking fun at being Lynch. Here, perhaps more than in any other work, he has found the perfect balance between the soap-operatic and the utterly bizarre--the filmic equivalent to author Harry Crews' best work.Tarantino doesn't tend to have pithy subtexts in his films, either, but they're no worse the wear for that, and when Wild at Heart takes a turn into typical Tarantino territory, Lynch is just as captivating, gritty and groovy, plus he's doing it before Tarantino himself. At the same time, Lynch manages to maintain a parallel lush, erotic romance between Sailor and Lula--Dern is incredibly sexy/sensuous here. This material works as well, and supplies what just may be the message of the film after all--that love can (eventually) conquer all, even the stuff that's \"wild at heart and weird on top\".</td><td>rw1134468</td><td>Beautiful, violent, funny and surreal--a masterpiece from David Lynch</td><td>BrandtSponseller</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(27, 33)</td><td>The Sword of Doom (1966)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>It's not especially deep, but it's a dark and disturbing chambara about a merciless samurai, Ryunosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai), who can  and will, without hesitation  kill anybody who challenges him with a sword. He sees himself as a force of karmic balance. The film starts off with him disposing of an old man praying for death. The film is based on a newspaper serial that began in the 1910s and continued for several decades. The story never really ended, and, likewise, the film, which only covers certain bits of the novel, has no resolution. This has often bothered people, but I think it works well. Whatever the case, even if the film doesn't satisfy you as a whole, there are a number of outstanding setpieces. Nakadai's being ambushed in the forest near the beginning. The battle in the snow, where Toshiro Mifune dispatches of a dozen or more attackers while Nakadai watches cautiously from the sidelines. And that final sequence is the mother of all rampages, where Nakadai goes apesh*t in a brothel. Tatsuya Nakadai is really a fantastic actor. I know, his performance here isn't particularly complex, but he is absolutely frightening in his infinite evil. Compare this to his overwhelming humanity in The Human Condition. Okamoto's direction is assured, and Hiroshi Murai provides some of the best black & white photography ever captured. The new Criterion disc is quite good. It is without extras, but the accompanying essay is a big help at putting the film and its source material in context.</td><td>rw1134469</td><td>A favorite of mine</td><td>zetes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 3)</td><td>The Stunt Man (1980)</td><td>9</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>\"The Stunt Man\" begins with an image of a vulture, which very soon after flies head-on into a helicopter, giving everyone on board the craft a momentary shock.\"That bird just tried to kill us!\" cries the helicopter pilot.\"That's your point of view,\" says a man in the back, biting an apple. \"Shall we stop and ask the bird what his was?\"\"The Stunt Man\" is a film about perspective, especially as we see director Eli Cross, the man with the apple, through the eyes of Cameron, a fugitive Vietnam veteran. Cross takes Cameron onto his latest film production after a mishap creates an opening for a new stunt man.Told he has much to learn, Cameron defensively tells his stunt coach, Chuck, \"I made it through Vietnam in one piece. That's a helluva stunt!\" But has Cameron jumped out of the pot and into the fire? He begins to think Cross is setting him up for the ultimate stunt by killing him in front of the camera. By turns flip and obsessive, Cross seems sinister even as he beguiles Cameron to step into his world. Even his very name seems to speak to this duality, suggesting both a double cross and a metaphor for a loving deity.I came to this movie by way of an excellent book by Danny Peary, \"Cult Movies 3,\" which championed \"The Stunt Man\" as a metaphysical metaphor and told the fascinating tale of how director Richard Rush struggled to get it released. Then I saw it for myself, and very quickly realized this was a classic. You have incredible camera work, hilarious dialogue, a dazzling central location at the historic Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, a wonderful sense of mise-en-scene from an assortment of colorful characters played by gifted actors, and especially a rich portrayal of Cross by Peter O'Toole.O'Toole seems so alive, you almost feel him breathing down your neck as he dips down from the heavens on his crane to offer another piece of whimsical advice. He's intense, yet even when he screams at one of his crew for yelling \"cut\" on his film, revealing some of the monster Cameron suspects lurks under his smooth surface, you, like Cameron, are unable to take your eyes off the SOB.Over the years, I've watched it a few more times and come to realize Steve Railsback as Cameron gives a performance every bit O'Toole's equal. Cameron is someone we don't know a lot about, either, other than he's in trouble and needs help. The crime he's being chased for is a mystery, though he throws up dark hints of war atrocities that might be true or else just Cameron's skewed sense of humor, projecting what he thinks others think of him, the grunt from 'Nam.Railsback was best known before \"The Stunt Man\" for playing Charles Manson, and there are times you wonder whether Cameron is a similar character. Railsback plays him as an idealist, badly bruised, with eyes that smolder with a glint of insanity every now and then. He's likable most of the time, enough for us to root for him when he falls in love with a third mysterious character, a lovely actress on the set named Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey). But we are always on guard.\"The Stunt Man\" keeps us on guard throughout, playing with our perspective by showing us seemingly straightforward scenes that turn out to be illusions or subjective visions. The film delivers several elaborate stunts, performed by Cameron on the set of Cross's World War I picture. Some like Peary complain, validly, that the stunts come off as too cartoony, not realistic as they seem to be filmed as one-take deals, and Cameron doesn't seem to know what he's doing even as he goes through his paces with apparent aplomb.But director Rush is playing with us here, delivering a subtle surreal layer to the film that keeps it (and us) off-center while simultaneously commenting on both the nature of the movies as illusion dispenser and of man's situation in a seemingly capricious and arbitrary world.The film is also very funny, so much so that many wrongly describe it as a comedy. It has some over-the-top comic moments, some slapstick, and clever dialogue throughout, but it never lets us stop worrying for poor Cameron. There are a lot of ways this film could have ended in that light, but I can't think of a better way of doing it than the way they did.About the only annoying thing for me is the business of Eli shooting an antiwar film. The metaphor seems lost in the bits of this film-within-a-film we see on screen, and the dialogue between Eli and his writer on this point drag on, except in the indirect way it creates a link with Cameron, a war veteran.So much else is great, though, I wonder how it failed to find a big audience. It's a deep, philosophical film, but with all the stunts, wonderfully goofy dialogue, and the herky-jerky romance between Cameron and Nina, there's something here for anyone who chances to see it. Like the wonderful score by Dominic Frontiere which girds the proceedings, \"The Stunt Man\" is by turns rousing, evocative, and sinister, a classic one gets lost in again and again.</td><td>rw1134470</td><td>Camera On!</td><td>slokes</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 7)</td><td>The Andy Milonakis Show (2005–2007)</td><td>null</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>andy milonakis.......what can i say about andy milonakis? in all honesty, the andy milonakis show must have been the end result of a drunken discussion had among jimmy kimmel and his associates on a Saturday night. how anyone would classify this junk as \"comedy\" is, in my opinion, totally beyond me. some may say that mr. milonakis is the second coming of tom green, but in reality, this is not the case; tom green, in terms of actually funny comedy, dwarfs milonakis. tom green had a natural edge, an energy that the MTV audience could not let go of, despite his crazy antics. in laymen's terms, whatever he did, TOM GREEN WAS FUNNY.

Certainly groundbreaking and incredible to think one person made such a beautiful, well directed piece of animation that is seriously on par with the most professional 3D animated films out there now. The slow pacing of the film that allowed the viewer to be pulled into the world and recognize the beauty of some of the backgrounds and renders is very much appreciated.Unfortunately the plot was thin and eventually had no real ending. Much like many other indie animators out there, the artist made something that is only a small fraction of what probably is a grand epic in his mind. Much of the dialog and plot is petty cliché-ish holier-than-thou peace-loving hero-talk. Also, it felt very strange to watch this movie because the main character acts so odd. Some of the shots and direction seemed a bit pretentious, as well as some of the story. It's like the artist was pandering to himself by the posing of the characters. At the end I was wondering of the main character and all the other characters were homosexual. There was no story, dialog, or plot to show that but that's the only way to explain how it felt. I have nothing at all against homosexuality, I'm a huge liberal in fact, but that's what I got out of this film: an overbearing feeling of homosexuality despite the fact the film had nothing to do with that. You have to watch it to understand what I mean, just watch how it plays out, and I am not talking about Kaze acting girly or anything like that. I mean yeah, there was a lot of very overly sensitive, seemingly forced crying and emotions going on here that seemed really oddly placed, but that's only part of it. Watch it, you'll know what I am talking about when you see it. I am not joking or trying to make this movie look bad or anything, that is my honest opinion and I'm surprised no one has ever mentioned this. The reason I mention this is because it had no place in the movie and as such it detracted from the film as a whole. The artist was obviously trying to create a dramatic piece but what comes out is almost fetishistic and disturbing. If they had some sort of better reason to act this way then that would be acceptable. In fact I'd be really impressed and satisfied if a gay character in a fantasy cartoon was pulled off really well. Instead it just seems strangely out of place. Imagine all of those ridiculous movies, video games, and TV shows where an unnecessarily sexy female warrior is in a serious story. That's just pandering to the audience and the filmmakers. That's what I am talking about here, just replace her with (seemingly gay) male characters.As for the animation, it is top notch. There could be a few tweaks done to make some things seem to have more weight, and some of the action scenes seem not to fulfill what you can tell could have been great potential, but check out the rendering, the facial animation, and the emotion conveyed by all the subtle movement.The sound really needs work. Obviously the time frame of production on this film probably kept it from being better. The eerily silent parts of the film aren't artistic, rather they are annoying. The small amount of music here is great but there is very little of it. A good film doesn't need music but this film really needs something because the empty sound space, as I said before, doesn't work at all. It seems more like a huge mistake or oversight. More sound effects are needed and some of the scenes sound strange. For instance there is a scene where a chair breaks and it sounds loud but kinda like a 'generic' sound effect from a sound library. But the other sound effects are absent or very low, so the ending result is something that looks like an incomplete production.If this was a feature-length movie that explored the story in-depth, this film was definitely going in the right direction. Like I said before, the pacing and visuals of the film would have been perfect for such an endeavor. However, the artist of this film needs a solid story writer, a strong short story with a beginning-middle-end, a good sound person, and a good editor to take out some of the pretentiousness. Then he would have an award winning film. I ask you all who seem to love this film, look past how pretty it is and ask yourself does this film really redeem itself in any other ways.</td><td>rw1134472</td><td>pretty and very impressive feat, but needs a real story</td><td>zodreb</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>It Was 20 Years Ago Today (1987)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>I recorded this documentary off of the Discovery network. I played it at least a hundred times and showed it to everyone I knew. Then in about 2003 I found out there was an even longer version of the film which an acquaintance had taped from PBS. It is based on a book of the same name by Beatles publicist Derek Taylor. It really isn't just about the Sgt. Pepper album, but uses it as a platform to discuss a variety of experiments in the counterculture. Having only been 10 years old in 1967, I was clueless about these social changes. It goes into everything: experiments in the Netherlands, Hoppy Hopkins arrest for marijuana in the UK, San Francisco culture, mass arrests in L.A., the Diggers, the underground press in the UK and the US, the anti-war movement, the levitation of the Pentagon, pot and LSD, the influx of Eastern religions, psychedelic art and music, happenings, the Monterey Pop Festival, the San Francisco Be-in, and of course Sgt. Pepper. I've watched anything I could get ahold of about the 1960s (including the 6 hour PBS special \"Making Sense of the Sixties\") but nothing comes close to this film in capturing the range of ideas being explored at the time or the exhilaration of it. The film features many important participants of the times: Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, Abbie Hoffman, Paul Kantner, Peter Coyote, Ron Thelin, Barry Miles, Chet Helms, Allen Cohen, and so many others. The role of Sgt. Pepper was to put a small slice of the counterculture in the bedrooms of millions of kids around the world. It took the counterculture from a cult interest to a mainstream interest. If you haven't seen this film and you are a sixties buff, it is essential viewing. We have seen a few countercultures since this time, like the punk movement and the rave scene, but neither of those seem to have had the breadth or heart of the 1960s breakthroughs. I think this is why the 60s counterculture is a reference point for youth of each succeeding generation. \"It Was Twenty Years Ago Today\" is an excellent introduction to the 1960s and the Sgt. Pepper album.</td><td>rw1134474</td><td>THE classic documentary on the 1960s</td><td>soulquest7</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>Phenom (1993–1994)</td><td>null</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>I thought Phenom was great.

So the ideas in the play are Shaw's, not Julius Caesar's, and that renders the finished product a bit difficult to assess, I suggest, without taking into account the structure of the play from which its screenplay was 'adapted\". as well as the historical context upon which it comments. The decision to make much of the play on soundstages was typical of the period, I assert, but does not always work to the finished product's advantage. However, anyone seeing the film for the first time would know it is an \"A\" production, and he or she would have to admit that the use of color is unusually rich and fine. The battle scenes are serviceable; the cast is extraordinary. Also, the finished product conveys Shaw's message very clearly--about avoiding extremes as a ruler, which is a necessary message to would-be rulers or even statesmen in any Age, especially our own at this time... The story begins with Julius Caesar, recent victor over his father-in-law Pompey the Great in a terrible Roman civil war arriving in Egypt in pursuit of the escaped opponent. He goes out alone by night to ponder his own mortality and worldly power, addressing his remarks to the aged monument The Great Sphinx. Cleopatra is listening there--he wonders if she is a divine child when he first meets her; and she calls him, \"old gentleman\", not recognizing him. The next day, he takes over the country, and meets the horrible Egyptian royal court. The girl has a nasty little brother, a bad adviser, a tough general and a murderous Nurse named Ftatateeta. he makes Cleopatra Queen, under him; his army holds the balance of power; and with his interesting staff, including a secretary Britannus, an old soldier named Rufio, and an aide named Lucius, he proceeds to be nearly assassinated and then to fight off an attack by the Egyptian army led by its fine general , Achillas. The remainder of the film consists in him trying to teach Cleopatra to be a queen and not a monster, and tell her why he is not doing terrible reprisals to every enemy.. He is only partly successful. The great Library of Alexandria has been burned during the battle, he is still in a somewhat precarious position, and she is bloodthirsty; her killing of Ftatateeta is justified but she enjoys it too much. By the time Caesar leaves, promising to send his friend Antony to console her for his absence, as he returns to Rome, we are in no doubt that Caesar's way would be best--and that Egypt for the Egyptians would be catastrophic. There is one rather spectacular scene as a hoist ascends to Caesar's level; and there is also the forming of a testudo or \"turtle\" formation with a roof of shields during the fire and the escape by leaping into the harbor by Caesar and others is well done. But overall, this is a play where human beings caught in a fascinating historical era's most-charged situation actually talk to one another. The screenplay by playwright Shaw is unusually literate for a film; and Gabriel Pascal's direction contributes to the overall dramatic movement even where physical movement may be wanting. Shaw and the director wring out many unusually fine nuances of character, attitude and reaction everywhere. The credits name Georges Auric as contributor of music, Oliver Messel as costume creator and credit Messel and John Bryan for the lovely art direction. Important cinematographers Jack Cardiff, Jack Hildyard, Robert Krasker   and Freddie Young  all received screen recognition as well. Among the actors, Vivien Leigh, then 32, portrayed a teenaged girl quite interestingly; she made a vivacious potential-monster, irresponsible-queen. Claude Rains works hard as Caesar but lacks a bit of vocal power to gain the credit for his intelligent try an extremely demanding part; he is very good, as is Stewart Granger as the by-contrast athletic young Apollodurs. Cecil Parker played Britannus the bookish slave, with Franics L. Sullivan as the wicked Pothinus, the young King's evil Svengali, Basil Syndey was a stout Rufio and Raymond Lovell and Anthony Eustrel were Lucis and Achillas respectively. Flora Robson deserved an award for her monstrous man-strangling Nurse. The remainder of the cast was filled with lesser knowns and soon-to-be-know performers such as Michael Rennie; Leo Genn; Alan Wheatley; Stanley Holloway; Esme Percy, Ronald Shiner, Renee Asherson, Jean Simmons, Kay Kendall, Valentine Dyall, Roger Moore Zena Marshall, Michael Cacoyannis, and Louis de Wohl. This feature film is perhaps not a great movie, but it was very- intelligently scripted, and it is still absorbing, physically stunning in many scenes and expensive without ever being overwhelmed by its own sets nor embarrassed by its historical re-creations. I found it well worth waiting fifty years to see; and I would enjoy seeing it redone, by a great writer and an equally great cast.</td><td>rw1134476</td><td>Physically Lovely; Colorful; Well-Acted and Intelligent</td><td>silverscreen888</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(28, 30)</td><td>Nid de guêpes (2002)</td><td>9</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>For some people the words 'French' and 'Action Movie' will do nothing but produce guffaws. Pay no attention; they know nothing about the lengthy history of superb French Action Films. The French actually produce some good movies from time to time. They are not all pretentious 'Arthouse' flicks which involve lots of shagging and boring dialogue. Jean-Pierre Jeunet gave us Delicatessen and 'The City of Lost Children' - he then made 'Alien:Resurrection' but we forgave him when he delivered 'Amelie'. Then there is Luc Besson who gave us 'Subway', 'Nikita' as a warm up then the fabulous 'Leon' ('The Professional' in the US) and the superb 'Fifth Element'. If you check the production companies involved on those last two you will find that they are entirely French, only US distributors were involved. Besson has sort-of disappeared from movie making for a while, concentrating on producing and writing cheapo European action films like 'The Transporter' and 'Taxi' 1&2 (not the lame US remakes). The reason for this lengthy preamble is to point out that not all French films are dull, and illustrate the fact that actually the French have a lot to teach a jaded Hollywood in how to make action movies. Which brings me to 'The Nest'. I watched John Carpenter's fantastic 'Assault on Precinct 13' when I was probably 15 and bored one evening. I didn't know anything about Carpenter, the film had no recognizable stars and I had no idea what was going to happen. Needless to say the film is excellent. It was the first time in my cinema going life that I felt not just wonder when watching a film, but also claustrophobia, oppression and genuine fear. 'The Nest' is a total remake of 'Assault'. It doesn't hang about (though its setup is maybe a little longer and a smidge wider-ranging than Assault's), introducing three groups of characters so quickly that you genuinely have no idea what they are up to. Sami Naceri, the star of the hugely daft Taxi films, is best known as a comic actor, yet plays successfully against type here (why isn't he a star on the same level as Jean Reno by now?)Pascal Greggory has the looks and presence of a hit-man, but is actually a security guard, Nadia Fares looks like a catwalk model, but utterly convinces as the military enforcer. The lesser characters (which isn't really fair as this is a purely ensemble piece of work) all inhabit their characters completely, their complex relationships spark off believable dialogue that never once slips into cliché. It is this commitment to reality that underlines 'The Nest' and makes it so successful. Almost the entire film takes place in a single warehouse, which is similar to 'Assault' except that Carpenter's film had a number of locations within the police house. The Nest has three areas - a Boiler room, a security desk that has a clear view over the entire warehouse, and the warehouse itself. Although this lessens the claustrophobia somewhat, it is hugely successful in putting all of our characters in peril at once. Another twist is that in 'Assault' the characters can retreat through to another room of the building. Early on in 'The Nest' it becomes clear that their only area of retreat has already been compromised by the enemy. The warehouse almost becomes a character itself, as the film becomes more and more desperate, the lights are removed and the shadows glower and threaten. Only bullet holes let in any more light, leaving shafts of light to taunt the stars with the hope they may get out of this alive. This realism (which isn't entirely there in the plot TBH), extends to wounds. A character is shot in the thigh early on in the film and spends the rest of the film limping painfully about. Other characters are injured throughout the events and stay injured, they don't suddenly find the ability to fire guns after being shot in the shoulder. This is gritty film-making and helps make 'The Nest' so successful. It feels real, you don't know what characters are going to make it or not. This leads to genuine tension. We may have seen the story before (wounded character stays behind to protect his friends; scared character finds the inner strength to confront the enemies head on), but its presentation here feels exciting and, if not exactly fresh, new. Another major lesson that Hollywood should learn from this film is the way it looks. There are some magic shots in here - a standout is an exact remake of Charlie Sheen's airlift from the Jungle in Platoon (!) - which not only looks great, and is genuinely unusual, but also adds greatly to our understanding of the character involved. 'The Nest' is not original, it is also not high art. It is an extremely solid action picture that is unusually exciting and tense. The director, Florent-Emilio Siri, conjures up desperation, hopelessness and genuine evil from his group of talented character actors as well as successfully re-creating Carpenter's feeling of an unstoppable army out to get them. The idea that the villains are insectile and swarming around outside highlighted by the low-light headgear they all wear is interesting and well illustrated. Siri got the gig directing Bruce Willis in 'Hostage', which is interesting as I would genuinely rate 'The Nest' alongside Willis' 'Die Hard' as examples of how to do an action movie well.

It's not a horror film, per se, and if you are expecting to be scared like with 28 Days Later, you will be disappointed, but it is a very entertaining comedic drama about a post-zombie-apocalyptic Mexican bad-ass named Matool who is actually happier now that the dead are walking the Earth because bashing them with a combination of kung fu and a solid hammer is the first thing he was ever good at and enjoyed in this world. Matool is shanghaied by a gun toting stranger looking for bedroom fodder for his swinger wife and her freak show sister. Naturally, Matool is eager to please. However, when a trio of wounded soldiers who have been ambushed by a new strain of hyper fast zombie show up at the house, the husband begins to wonder if there are too many roosters in the chicken coop. Tensions rise, zombies attack, alliances shift, but perhaps the ultimate factor is one that the audience has not even considered.The acting is good, especially the main characters, Matool, Nathan, and Mandel. Matool is a likable protagonist, along the lines of a Quentin Tarantino type, perhaps. The tension isn't unbearable, but the unique plot has the audience genuinely interested in what the heck is going on and how it will turn out. The fight scenes are well choreographed and fun, and the dialog is sensible and well spoken. These are not your standard cut and paste horror movie lines.

Margaret doesn't even know that she's supposed to inheirit anything from Mrs. Wilcox, since their relationship was brief. When Margaret winds up married to Henry, the former Mrs. Wilcox's will is finally carried out, but not without plenty of objection by Henry's spoiled children.At the same time Leonard Bast, a banker, has fallen on hard times. After taking bad advice from Henry, Leonard has been left in a low-paying job, believing that his previous place of employment is going out of business. Instead, the place booms. Margaret and her sister Helen, who set up Leonard to receive Henry's advice, feel responisble and Margaret demands that Henry give Leonard a job. Henry's refusal leads to great tension in the Wilcox household.Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson star in this Merchant-Ivory production. Their fantastic chemistry, later used to brilliant effect in \"Remains of the Day\", a Merchant-Ivory masterpiece, is evident throughout. Hopkins has a way of making even his posture pretentious and condescending. He bends at the waist, as if looking down on everyone, and his sense of overwhelming confidence makes him easily hateable. Emma Thompson is just the opposite. She is warm, welcoming, and open to everyone.It is when the two meet that things get really interesting. Thompson's Margaret is someone that Hopkins' Henry can not bring himself to look down upon, and his confidence breaks. The conversation in which Henry proposes perfectly shows Henry's true self: unconfident, bad with words, and afraid to be turned down.\"Howards End\" is a great film; a scathing critique of hypocrisy and classism, and at the same time a tale of a man who is too afraid to be himself, and a woman who refuses to be anything but herself. It's richly and densely layered, with a complex story. Under the direction of James Ivory and with the incredible acting ability of everyone involved, Howards End is a triumphant adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel.</td><td>rw1134489</td><td>A Scathing Critique of Classism</td><td>CSM126-1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(3, 6)</td><td>Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003)</td><td>1</td><td>22 July 2005</td><td>The first Jeepers Creepers film was an entertaining if somewhat unoriginal film, and it drifted a bit in the second half.

The same can be said for the rest of the film; it has promise but the tedious buildup lacks any kind of payoff. There is no tension, atmosphere or suspense to leven the tedium. When the creeper finally gets off his ass to terrorise the bus load of kiddywinks -and what a bunch of stereotypical dullards they all are!- there is no sense of horror or terror to the proceedings. The film is simply laughable. The actors are all bland and barely distinguishable, but more importantly, the characters are poorly written and charmless. The creeper looks rather crap when shown in closeup too much, lacking any sense of creepiness he had in the original; the cruddy flying element of the character only adds to the list of foolishly poor ideas the filmmakers bring to the table. The ending is also extremely protracted and obvious without any kind of payoff; its like watching paint dry fer chrissakes! Give this film a miss for the love of God! Its really not worth your time. I give it 1/10 but only because I'm feeling charitable!

After a screening at the Rice University Media Center in Houston, several attendees mentioned the urge they felt to get up and applaud 20yr old concert footage. The filmmakers did an excellent job of breaking up current interviews with footage they shoot throughout the band's early years. Surviving members of the band and other music contemporaries reminisce about why the Minutemen stood out and were so important. These ideas are then highlighted by concert footage or an archived interview with the band shortly before the death of D. Boon. For example, seeing Mike Watt today talk about growing up in San Pedro and the aggravations of trying to start a band in a small town is accentuated with comments he makes twenty years prior as the band is starting to taste national exposure. Whether you are a fan of the Minuteman, or alternative rock in general, shouldn't matter in choosing this film. The story resonates around the childhood friendship between D. Boon and Mike Watt and how it produced a sound that was one of the most creative in the history of rock n' roll. Imagine a twenty-year class reunion but only the people you liked are going to attend.

It stars Maurice Chevalier as a tailor who falls in love with a princess played by Jeanette MacDonald. I think both did better in The Merry Widow two years later. Myrna Loy, Charles Ruggles and C. Aubrey Smith co-star - and are given nothing to do. Well, C. Aubrey Smith sings a couple of times, which is actually amusing to see. Any movie where the hero has to decide between Jeanette MacDonald and Myrna Loy and he picks MacDonald strains believability. Mamoulian's direction is nice, but he also did better the next year with Queen Christina.

It was truly unjust and I hope that they get a better and fairer trail in their appeal. I do feel for the family of the victim, but to portray him as an innocent by stander (I mean his good friend did sell drugs) while his family tore apart the parents of the other children. His father was a detective and his son was involved in drugs. The one child who stabbed (and admitted it) the victim should do time and there is no hesitation in that.

The screenplay by Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci attempt to breathe fresh air into a tired sub genre  the sci-fi morality fable and totalitarian warning of a bleak future with middling results but Bay knows how to keep the pulse quicken with his trademark breakneck editing and pacing particularly in the film's climactic hairy car chase sequence that makes it worth the price of admission to see the carnage on a huge screen.

Jacques Audiard, who made the excellent \"Read My Lips\" in 2001, has here produced a French version of James Toback's hard-boiled but rather odd \"Fingers\" (1978) in which Harvey Keitel stars as a loan shark's collector who aspires to be a concert pianist. Here, a rather more handsome Romaine Duris stars as Thomas, a real estate developer (a lower form of life than a loan shark in France, it seems) who also aspires to the concert platform, following in the footsteps of his late mother. Thomas meets by accident his mother's former manager who, remembering Thomas's talent as a child, suggests he audition. Thomas hires Miao Lin, a Chinese pianist studying at the Paris Conservatorium to show him how, though she speaks no French. In the meantime his chaotic life lurches on; he continues to evict tenants and squatters, do dirty deals, come to the aid of his aging and disorganized father, and help his partner to deceive the partner's wife.Yet strangely his playing improves until Miao Lin, a lady of very high standards, compliments his playing, and he fronts up for the audition to play a Bach Toccata and Fugue in Morris Minor, or whatever. It would be unfair to tell you the rest, but suffice to say it's not a fairy story, and Glenn Gould went mad trying to get the Toccata and Fugue right.Although this film has some of the elements of a thriller, as well as a rake's progress, it is essentially a character study of a fairly odd guy. Thomas has a curious relationship with his dissolute and not very charming father  their roles are almost reversed. He is contemptuous of women yet submits to Miao Lin's authority. He is not a nice person yet the viewer would like to see him climb out of the mire.Well, if the portrayal of real estate ethics in France is anything like the truth I sincerely hope I never have dealings with a French real estate agent. I found the film engrossing but Thomas was hard to identify with.

People were understandably a little sceptical of Rob Zombie's debut as a director, but knowing myself that the man is a scholar of the modern horror movie and a raving fanboy himself, I had high expectations of House. I was not disappointed. From the demented and hilarious opening sequence through to the surreal and terrifying ending, Zombie's first foray into direction and writing gives the world of cinema a much needed boot in the pants.Is it gory? Well, yeah, it is, but it's never gory in an absolutely horrific fashion. What's such a pleasant surprise is that the movie, despite being a homage to the bleak and nihilistic 70s horror boom, is full of well-painted, full-bodied characters and rich dark humour. House of 1000 Corpses is an absolute blast to watch, never wallowing in darkness and only really becoming a terror-ride toward the very end, meaning it's a movie that while not for all the family could well put a smile on at least some of their faces.The movies combination of gore-soaked serial-killer horror, Tim Burtonesque visuals and Evil Dead's sense of humour is a fresh turn from a genre currently stuck largely in bleak apartment buildings full of long-faced pouty heroines and even longer-faced pouty ghouls. Yeah it isn't that tense, but it's wickedly funny, wonderfully psychedelic and chock full of demented set-pieces. To be honest, I'd almost forgot what it was like to be entertained by horror before I watched this.A lot of people love to dissect this movie and venerate it's influences, but the bottom line is unlike Kill Bill which relied on you being as nerdy as Tarantino to enjoy it, Zombie's movie is fun whether or not you've seen the movies he doffs his threadbare circus hat to. It's a warped, psychedelic delve into mania that'll make you laugh out loud and keep you on the edge of your seat. Watch it. Watch it ASAP.</td><td>rw1134501</td><td>Can we get a hell yeah?

Not surprising that they are so hard considering they were first made for the arcade and it's a ploy by SNK for you to spend more money playing it. Now everything you loved about Metal Slug is on the Gameboy Advance, with a few new bonuses. One of them is the card system, which I cared not for, which you are awarded for rescuing certain prisoners or destroying certain bosses. Personally, I didn't think this changed the game much at all. Second is that you can save your progress in Metal Slug Advance, which will comes as a huge relief to anyone who's just defeated a near-impossible boss and doesn't think they'll be able to do so again. There are only five (very hard) levels in this game and you'll get through them in a week.

I could see this is a fine show about two real life actors like Dame Judi Dench and Michael Williams (who did receive a papal knighthood) playing two odd characters like a linguist and a landscaper. Judi plays Laura, the intellectual linguist, and Michael plays Mike, the quiet shy landscaper. At first, this is an unlikely pairing but you know if you know anything about the great Dame Judi Dench (even though she prefer you call her just Judi, no Dame Judi or Ms. Dench). This is their romance. While Dame Judi receives a lot of attention, Michael is the wind beneath her wings. I paid a lot more attention to his role in this show. I can see why she fell in love with him. When Judi asked about her longtime marriage to Michael, she responded that \"they just enjoyed being in the same room together.\" Now that is a sign of a fine romance and an excellent relationship. Michael never did receive the fame or accolades as his wife but I know he was proud of her even now as she earns one of Britain's top honor, Companion of Honor, only 65 living people at a time can receive this honor. When Dame Judi earned her O.B.E. (Officer of the British Empire) in 1970, Michael was not there in her life. When she became Dame Judi, Mike and her daughter, Finty was there at the palace. Now, she has her grandson, Sam, and Finty for this special occasion. I will say the writing of this show could be better. The humor is much dryer than normal, it is very cerebral and intellectual. Susan Penhaligon and Richard Warwick are just fine as Laura's sister Helen and brother-in-law Phil. It really is the story of Mike and Judi's great relationship.

The label read EVIL DEAD II in a faded red typeface. Being English, I had no clue what to expect, I'd never heard of the original EVIL DEAD as it had been swept up in the BBFC's roundup of so-called \"Video Nasties\"(movies deemed likely by a short-sighted and infantile board of censors to \"deprave & corrupt\"). Either way, the weekend arrived, my house filled up with friends, the tape went in and we were changed forever.EVIL DEAD II a sequel to the original EVIL DEAD  the tragic tale of a group of teenagers assaulted by demonic forces while stranded in a remote cabin in the wilderness. EVIL DEAD II replayed the entirety of the first film (with several differences) in ten minutes, then brought more young folk out to the cabin to get generally mistreated by the demonic powers circling their cabin refuge like sharks at a shipwreck. Our hero is Ash, an average, slightly dumb guy who's out at the cabin with his girlfriend Linda. They find a tape recorder left by the previous tenant (a history professor working on the translation of an artefact he has discovered), and upon playing the tape release a demonic force into the woods around them. Linda gets possessed, Ash decapitates her with a shovel and then gets possessed himself (albeit temporarily). Plagued by demon-induced visions and a Linda that wont stay in buried, Ash descends into madness. Meanwhile four more victims arrive in the shape of the prof's daughter, a fellow colleague and a couple of local hicks out to make a quick buck. The circle is drawn, the demon's attacks build up in pace, and you just know it's all going to end in tears.EVIL DEAD II is like a ride on the best ghost train imaginable. It does not let up until the very end. Even the most ADHD-gripped teen can appreciate how balls-to-the-wall this movie is. Each gag is rapidly followed by another. I use the term \"gag\" as this movie, despite being filled with gore and violence, is funny. I mean fall on you ass laughing funny. Even when people are dying you have a malicious smile on your face. People get drenched in blood and goo, accidentally swallow eyeballs, get possessed and generally go mental, corpses are reanimated, trees come to life and attack and disembodied hands run amok. All the while the movie's tongue moves not an inch from its cheek. If you don't at least crack a smile at this film, you're probably dead already.Without a doubt though, this is Bruce Campbell's movie. As Ash he steals the show with bouts of world-class lunacy, crass cowardice, hammy scenery-chewing, physical comedy and occasional heroism. Ash is indeed a superhero in the making in this movie, soon after to become one of the greatest horror heroes ever. When he finally gets his act together to become the hero and dons his hero's \"armour\" I defy anyone not to think they're watching one of the coolest scenes in cinema history. Ash might be an idiot, but you'd want him at your six if demons were attacking your neighbourhood.The script is at times a bit limited and clunky, and some of the other performances are minimal. Also the effects sometimes look seriously bargain-basement. It doesn't matter in the slightest though. This is a film made with real passion, a sense of humour, and no desire to do anything that scare and delight the viewer. It's horror from a simpler age; one not afraid to be silly or gross in equal parts. It's classics like this that have cemented Sam Rami's career as a director to watch long before SPIDERMAN. EVIL DEAD II is without a doubt one of the greatest horror movies ever made. And if you've never seen it, there's only one thing you can do.

I might have found something to laugh at if I didn't see recycled clichéd jokes or jokes that were obvious from a mile away. It's funny the creators of the Simpsons come up with another smash split-your-side treasure like \"Futurama\" which for some moronic reason Fox decided to cancel, and yet you have Family Guy which is basically the \"Simpsons\" with subtle enough changes to try and disguise the fact it is a blatant rip-off and Fox actually puts on another show of this very low caliber. I heard that most of the scripts for \"Laverne and Shirley\" were rejected \"I Love Lucy\" scripts. You gotta wonder, is \"Family Guy\" and \"American Dad\" where rejected \"Laverne and Shirley,\" \"Happy Days,\" \"Mork and Mindy,\" \"Three's Company,\" and other clichéd stereotypical shows scripts have gone.

Off the back of a Mark Kermode review in The Observer I thought I would give it a crack - particularly as my girlfriend's a horror fan and I needed to redeem the genre after suffering her making me watch Creep. The plot is basic and borrows from numerous other horror films. Group of friends \"with issues\" get trapped in dark place with nasty things there out to get them. However, the way the material is realised on screen keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat, jumping repeatedly, however telegraphed the scares are, and cringing away from the fairly gruesome gore. One scene in particular when the group use the infra red setting on a camcorder to check everyone is OK had the entire cinema (including myself) screaming - an experience completely new to me and a real pleasure to endure. The pace is very cleverly set, with a slow, but never boring, build up of menace as the women's situation plummets from bad to downright hellish, before exploding in a finale that will leave you scared, breathless and absolutely terrified of the dark. I have never ever had the desire to go potholing, but now would probably go so far as to sit through Hollow Man, Vertical Limit AND Weekend at Bernie's II before venturing below the earth's crust into a dark hole. Go and see it... please! I was really pleasantly surprised and have been telling everyone I know to go and see it whereas normally by attachment to a movie ends when I leave the cinema.

Just a fun story with some clever dialog about a schlep running for class president who gets possessed by a demon from a website. After spouting predictions of mankind's doom in arcane language and copious projectile vomiting, he is ultimately exorcised and, of course, gets a girlfriend.

Even the idea behind the Nightmare on Elm Street series, while very intriguing at the beginning of the saga, ends up relying on Freddie Krueger and his violent entries rather than on subtly suggesting new hints as to why and how we experience nightmares. This movie, that I saw on Italian TV, and then more recently at Deepcon, uses exactly the opposite approach. No one and nothing is inherently terrifying. As a matter of fact the atmosphere exudes calm and reassurance. But when the notion underlying the story becomes clearer (I won't tell you what that is!) you realize you are walking on totally unfamiliar ground. Too bad these guys didn't have the resources to develop it into a long running movie. It would have been anxiety nonstop. When we dream the feeling of fear does not come from what we recall of the nightmare itself, but from the inexplicable sensation of anxiety as we wake up. The recollection is so fragmented, but the anguish is all there. I think this short interprets the phenomenon of night terrors very well, in a realistic way.

Jackson plays a rich investor who decides to check out the progress on this work at a remote installation in the middle of the ocean. Very bad timing. Pretty soon, the crew and scientists are being picked off by a trio of nasty man-eaters which can think their way around our technology. Current special FX allow us to see stuff which was not possible a few years earlier. Needless to say, most of the cast are chewed into hamburger and the filmmakers do not spare us the full details of the various dismemberments, but, curiously, the effect is less gross and more in the vein of cartoon-style violence. Perhaps the modern mind instinctively knows that what we're seeing is not really happening, despite the incredible realism. Then again, if your DVD player is capable of freeze-frame/slow motion, you may notice in a couple of spots the fake cartoony blood inserted digitally.

She has been around with him since her childhood and adolescence and adulthood, both had spent enough time together during their growing age  must have shared comics, novels, shared jokes , discussed classmates, movies etc. fought over small things and then must have made up like it happens when you are family friends.Anyways, she meets this truck driver owner - and maybe the stars were not in her favour at that particular point of time, she falls in love with him! He impresses her by saying things like he will be like an obedient dog to her, he knows homeopathy so he can cure minor health ailments thus saving money etc.She rejects him and goes back to her foreign home  he follows her there  waiting to see her in her bridal dress at least  see the last of her ie.  she ultimately decides to marry him! For God only knows what reason  the movie tries to imply that she fell in love  FELL mind you so apt is this word indeed! They come back to India and he opens his flat door  he is an orphan mind you  and because he had seen in movies and other families to take the impression of the newly wed bride's feet , he brings Talcum powder and asks her to step on it  thus making impression  Cool  making fun of age old rituals ! anyways they begin to pay for it soon.  She belonged to a high class, cultured and educated family whereas he was an orphan with no family or cultural background ! so started the fights  wet towel on dry bed much to her annoyance, shoes and smelly socks thrown all around the house, no civic sense in hubby  she tries her level best to adjust to his style  uncouth and coarse style ie.He understands her problems- starts to spend more time in office to earn more all for hercome home late and watches TV  while she is cooking and washing the utensils as they cannot afford to keep a maid for dearth of moneyimagine a rich, high class girl washing utensils and cooking for husband !(Attention men: this does not happen in real life  an educated and balanced woman will always look for a match either of the same level or higher  definitely not lower  the body / mind / soul system does not accept it so easily  unless it's a natural calamity or some accident in the family/society that drastic change of life style takes place  eg. Tsunami hit children probably will have no choice)they even plan to have children on top of dearth of money ! some stupidity it is really  why bring a baby when you cannot provide for its basic needs and necessities ? Such children, who grow up in financial crunch / dearth but at the same time see that his/her classmates bring cakes and patties for tiffin, they become jealous and greedy and later ask their parents what have they provided them with anyways ?- (refer son Samir soni's dialogue to father Amitabh Bachhan in Baagban).In one scene Rani calls the washer- man by his name to her rich Aunt's surprise ! she was amazed at the fact that Rani called him by his name ! whats so amazing about this is what I failed to understand !! with so many revolutions  green and white etc. where equality begets equanimity etc. has been talked aboutstill there are IDIOTS who think that knowing the name and addressing the helper by his/ her name is a shame !! such IDIOTS should better be kicked out of the countryrather the world.Anyways the inevitable happens  there is a calamity in office and they get under pressure of paying heavy debts. Wife seeks ex-flame's help financially and hubby truck driver becomes jealous !  he insults both wife and ex-flame  teases him for being Brand conscious  wearing branded shirts  basically showing his true color  a looser in all respect - unsuccessful husband and business man !

He turns her down as is has a better deal in hand  a rich, well endowed, beautiful , seductress looking woman for whom all men yearn ! Ash, in order to win his heart tries to look voluptuous and seductress by wearing skimpy outfits as suggested to her by Indian cab drivers, and others of their category, but it does not work ...she sings thusly: dear dear turn around your sight  your heart is here  where else are you looking ! its night there  its only here (with me) that's broad daylight) Heart broken she joins as a nurse to a multi billionaire who is Akshaya's (hero's) actual father actually  had humped his mother and later had settled down in foreign and was living happily ever after with wife and child.

He drowns in the entire ocean of fatherhood and gives away everything he had to the son born to him  once up on a time.Conclusion: Everyday is not a weekday for a son born out of wedlock !

On the strength of this work by a relatively few dedicated people working for NOTHING and with a budget (insofar as I know) of AROUND $24000, the glaring disparity becomes clear, how much money is simply being poured down the toilet? how many millions? where is it all going? can actors still be justified in receiving pay packages of millions per film? No, not really, and a production such as this one will make people more aware of this fact. So well done for that.To the film- Bad points: Cheesy props ( the holocron), some awful attempts at voice impressions ( the emperor )- when will people learn that an American cannot dub the voice of an Englishman?! Especially with villains such as grand moff tarkin, count dooku and any sith with the exception of Darth vader , but then again James earl jones accent is very correct anyway and the voice is distorted. But an American 'drawl' Doesn't work! it's about as evil as a rubber chicken.TIE fighter pilots in awful choreography.Peoples hair is much too clean and well cared for (Declan) in fact most things could have done with being a bit more worn looking.Otherwise, Good points: Great costumes, amazing CGI, as good as a 'Proper' cinematic release, Costumes are great, nice park lightsabres popping out and going zummmmm, and the MUSIC is, well GREAT!!!

Like when Corina says: \"You Want to break some more China?\" b/c Ichigo/\"Zoey\" broke all those dishes. And there is that cute catch phrase \"Mew Mew style, Mew Mew grace, Mew Mew Power in your face.\" And the costume design is fantastic. The low-cut from the Manga is gone, but I think that's in both versions, judging by looking up picks. However the costume design is fantastic. And I haven't people I've heard already. Well, I heard Rachel Lillis (Pokemon) in one Episode, but she was an extra guest star. So over all this series is good. One of the more better. At least didn't give Yugi's voice (Dan Green) to \"Mark\" as he is called. Another gripe is, I just wish they didn't pick the name Zoey for Ichigo. I think the names are suitable. I find the Manga/Anime names, to be a tad bit ridiculous. (Except for Ichigo) Lettuce, Pudding, Mint, are these girls or are they food? Even though Ichigo's name does mean \"strawberry\" That doesn't bug me. They don't really try to hide Japanese culture too much. They haven't changed Kendo, or anything to that sort.

Tries her level best to raise her daughter in best possible ways  giving her the basic necessities, educating her, providing her food and wants to keep her away from obscenities, cheapness and vulgarity etc. It's a movie of the 19th century , so now you can well understand how difficult it is for parents to give their child a healthy environment.Now what makes an environment  Neighbors, newspapers, magazines, TV, Internetschool friends etc. is'nt it ? yes it is.Few turning points of a girl named carrie : 1. at the age of 7, she asks a shameless nude woman lying nude in the garden what her breasts were all about ! Now S L U T woman are the kinds who can lie like that in front of public to watch  no mother  a righteous one  can ever stand her daughter being exposed to such vile women  so she beat her up  the poor lil' carrie ynderstood nothing. Mother thought that she is just doing the right thing.2. Mother never told daughter about Chums (periods, Menstrual cycle  which the girls now-a-days are seen celebrating in the TV advertisements)! it comes to her as a surprise in school  other class mates make fun of her  except one girl (very attractive African girl with sparkling eyes  I really liked her eyes  do not know her name). Later of course all the girls are given a dose of a lifetime by the Instructress and she throws Tampons at them  to teach the girls a lesson  The Instructress was also very attractive to look atI like such chiseled facial features .3. The good friend of Carrie requests her boyfriend to ask Carrie for a date to the College fest PAM .or something. He agrees and asks Carrie out. Carrie who had read in magazines and in fairy tales since her childhood about Prince Charming coming and etc. was very happy.4. In the meanwhile Carrie had learnt Telekinesis ( Mind Control and contacting the subtle world) through the Internet  since she was alone and hardly had any friends and other stupidities like partying, picnicking, gossiping etc. she could concentrate and even succeed in receiving the services of the Subtle world.5. She tailors a dress for herself  a plunging neckline- revealing her cleavage and shoulders  to her mother's horror  her mother could not stop her as she had come to know of Carrie's super natural powers.and was rather afraid of her. She tries to tell her of some 13th chapter in Bible (I have not read the Bible in so much detail actually  sorry!) - where it has been stated that women who seduce and wear such vulgar outfits burn in hell for eons !- but Carrie does not listen.6. In the mean while the other students  of idiot and sick parents , decide to drench Carrie in Pig's blood ! and by cheating, makes her win the dance contest she is invited on the stage to be given the award (my heart cried for her as I knew that soon she will be drenched in blood !)  and her happiest moment becomes the saddest moment for her .not because of God but because of children belonging to parents who are greedy, sick, jealous, vamp-ish and villain-aceous IDIOTS.7. Anyways  in order to give a lesson of a life time  the Higher Subtle Level  blocks the hall doors and many of them die - suffocated within the walls  short circuit happens  many students ..who were not even aware of what some miscreants had done  were burnt to death ! (quite like burning in hell.most girls actually wore revealing outfits by the way) they all die because of the mistake of a few (4-5 of them) Idiot-rabid-street-dog born sons and daughters ! 8.

The other is successful career-wise, with normal interests, as well. The filmmakers obviously wanted to show Trekkers as more than just weird geeks. However, something doesn't jibe with this presentation: the 2 guys come across as SO normal, it's hard to believe they've got every Trek episode memorized. That being said, this flic is a Trekker dream, filled with pop cultural references (for other Sci-Fi famous flics,too) and in-jokes that will probably baffle those not informed about Trek sayings & terminology (one scene is even filmed at a famous site from one of the classic episodes, but this was already done in \"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey\"/1991). In the plot, the 2 guys, who both work in the film industry in L.A., happen to spot their idol, William Shatner, in a bookstore (Shatner, who portrayed Capt.Kirk in the classic Trek series and movies, is played by ...William Shatner). He doesn't live up to their expectations of a hero, even coming across as a bit of a loon, setting the stage for the re-evaluation of their lives. In all, the movie comes across as a bit silly and even pointless, with non-too-subtle moralizing about what's important in life, and apparent low-budget origins. But even non-Trekkers should find it mildly amusing. The DVD even has explanations of all the arcane Trek references, including optional subtitles.

I was expecting a decent science fiction movie, instead I got a hacked up attempt at a sci-fi action/romance combination, with too many large nitpicks that it spoiled the experience.The story is pretty straight forward. A group of people live in isolation after being told that they are the survivors of some global catastrophe. They a mundane, but secure and physically fit life with promises that they will one day go to The Island, the last Utopian location on the planet. The main character, Lincoln-6-Echo, discovers the horrible truth; the people are in some kind of prison and everything they've been told is a lie. Eventually he escapes with Jordan-2-Delta and they discover that they are really clones of people in the \"real world\" that use the clones for body parts. They escape are on the run, then eventually return to free the other clones.The movie overall was good, it just had too many plot problem that just nagged on me enough to spoil the movie in general:1) The 2 fugitives escape from the compound with relative ease. Where is the security? How come they are able to walk down a long access bridge to freedom with NO ONE spotting them? They already fought security guards; no one is able to keep tabs on their position? 2) The main characters supposedly have the education of 15 year olds and they supposedly have almost NO knowledge of the \"real world\". Yet once they get to a train station and then to Los Angeles, they don't seem to have any problems getting around. I mean, they act stupid and don't know phrases like \"the can\", \"taking a dump\", \"dude\" and act incredulous around this. Yet they don't seem to have a problem navigating around a metropolis, which to them would be an alien environment. 3) The main characters get by with 5 movies worth of luck. They dodge trained military personnel. Survive drops from a skyscraper hundreds of feet in the air and manage to take out a helicopter while doing so. They are in a car when it gets totaled (cut in half!!) after getting side-swiped by an armored truck and walk away, not even dazed. I found it hard to empathize with the characters when they were in \"danger\" because they seemed to be invulnerable! 4) Clones with memories. This is a pet peeve of mine. Memories are NOT a part of a creatures DNA structure. A clone is simply a copy of a creatures physical make up. It cannot have the experience and memories of its donor, because the clone itself hasn't had those experiences or memories. Yet movies frequently portray a clone as not only having the same physical properties as a donor, but the same memories as well. Although, in this movie, the memories were mostly \"subconscious\". 5) When Jordan was brought back to the institution towards the end, NO ONE thought to search her for a weapon?!! 6) During some of the big action scenes (fighting with the guards while escaping and the big highway chase scene with the flying attack bikes) the camera kept shaking and it was hard to see what the heck was going on. Whats the point of seeing a movie, when the movie *itself* makes it difficult to see what is on the screen?!As the movie went on, these issues just keep accumulating until by the end, I just wanted to see the end.As a side note, I noticed that this movie was almost identical to merging together two other movies: Logans Run and Freejack. The movie has a man and a woman on the run, leaving an isolated society and encountering the world outside, only to return and \"free\" the people from the society (Logans Run). Meanwhile, they are on the run and hunted down by mercenaries, because their bodies are actually owned by some rich person (Freejack).Overall, I give the movie a 4 out of 10. I would give the movie a 7 out of 10 for just the story, but this is reduced for the annoying issues I mentioned previously.</td><td>rw1134538</td><td>Decent movie spoiled by glaring nitpicks</td><td>MadWatch</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(31, 64)</td><td>Missing in Action (1984)</td><td>2</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Hilarious! There is not another word to describe this film. I remember I've seen this when I'm 15 and I could not get a ticket to another film. This weekend I rented it  just to review what i already thought, 20 years ago, it was a disaster. It was a period of ufanistic productions where one hero could destroy anything that threats America or its ideal of freedom. Films like Rambo II, Red Dawn, Commando or Rocky IV looked seen to be wrote by someone at Reagan's office, but at least they had some qualities. This Braddock had none. Chuck Norris leads the scariest cast of all times (M Emmet Walsh should be punished to do a film like that - how come he had done Blood Simple later?). The screenplay does not make any sense (Braddock kills a character vital to the story  a big shot Vietnam general  and there are no consequences), the action scenes are primary (the sequence with the boat  that should be the climax! - seems to be shot by high school students), the cinematography is awful (mixing up sequences on a bright day and others made on a numb one). So... if you want to remember how the action movies in the 80's were disastrous without its great icons (Stallone and Schwarzenneger), take a look at Braddock...

I cried for about two hours straight after wards. It had never previously occurred to me how people, in war time, could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. We see several examples of this here - in both the scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home. I was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind. However, I am glad I watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own. The blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since I saw the film. His horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me. At one point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason,it only occurred to me afterward that I'd only be hitting a big screen - that shows the film's power and intensity at least).

The scripting and tone of CB is calculated to perfectly capture that unique Chris Elliot personae; the condescending, insufferably annoying, delusionallly self-satisfied, clueless idiot.It is the one movie that my friends and I watch over and over again when we get together and want to laugh in our cups. (that means we're drinking etc. ;-) for you less sophisticated CB haters)For the Cabin Boy fans: Watch the film \"Captains Courageous\" AFTER watching Cabin Boy...It's the 'serious' film CB is loosely parodying.

Theirs is a tiny, tumbledown, drafty old house but it is filled with love. Every night, the last thing Charlie sees from his window is the great factory, and he drifts off to sleep dreaming about what might be inside.For nearly fifteen years, no one has seen a single worker going in or coming out of the factory, or caught a glimpse of Willy Wonka himself, yet, mysteriously, great quantities of chocolate are still being made and shipped to shops all over the world.One day Willy Wonka makes an announcement. He will open his famous factory and reveal \"all of its secrets and magic\" to five lucky children who find golden tickets hidden inside five randomly selected Wonka chocolate bars. Of course, Charlie finds one of the tickets, and the surprises awaiting him within the factory give Charlie a certain glow inside.Tim Burton has done it again.This 'Charlie' is a considerable improvement on the film it remakes, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. Tim Burton's imagination gives the film a splashy look to it anf filling it with remarkable sights. Actor Johnny Depp is fantastic as offbeat and eccentric kid-at-heart Willy Wonka. Freddie Highmore gives a magical performance as the generous, curious Charlie, the poor boy eager to win a trip into Willy Wonka's factory.The remarkable thing about this 'Factory' is how visually stunning it is. Tim Burton lusciously imagined the film, and it's a feast for the eyes... and the imagination.

Sadly Nolan fails in the action department, and this lets the whole film down for me.

Revenge of the Syth looked great, but again George Lucas can not direct a decent lightsaber duel to save his life.

This was Rogers' 20+ film, but the wise cracking/endearing personality that she eventually developed for the Astaire movies had not yet appeared. She comes off stiff and unsure. Leading man Lyle Talbot, a veteran of almost 200 movies plays as Ginger's rival reporter, and a romance that started before this movie began blossoms despite some back-stabbing by each of the other. Talbot is excellent and carries the show. Notable performances are given by Pernell Pratt as the police detective and Harvey Clark as the janitor. Actress Louise Beavers who went on to make more than 160 films, many notable, plays the stereotypical \"negro\". The roll can be excused as it is a benchmark of the Hollywood problems of the times. The story, an excellent whodunnit written by Francis Hyland and Kurt Kempler, is good but gets muddled at the end. Even so it does not interfere with the understanding of the plot. There is a scene at the end that has gruesome implications but is not gratuitous and therefore adds to the depth of the story. One gaff I noticed: about 5 minutes into the picture Rogers is talking to the detective. She is smoking a cigarette (there's a lot of smoking going on through out the film) and he is smoking a cigar. While holding the smoking butt she leaves the room only to enter another room sans cigarette. It is very interesting to see the styles of dress and automobiles of the times.

It should be life affirming or even, at its best, life changing. But this is dreck, drivel and dross and utterly meritless.You can see how the director's thought processes were working - 'I like indie music. I like sex. I'l make a film about both and get some schmuck to finance it.' More like an extended short with no narrative and very little dialogue the film is summed up thus: the two leads go to rock concerts, shag then do the same again. And again. And again. That's it. People don't actually do anything or say anything much except a few mumblings here and there that is supposed to pass for conversation and communication. There's some attempt at an explanatory thread going on with a bizarre metaphor about Antarctica and how relationships are claustrophobic and agoraphobic at the same time.Thinking it has something profound to say about the human condition, this film is pretentious, self indulgent and self absorbed which, like the music, is all style and no substance - a film of such epic pseudo- intellectual proportions, it disappears up its own arse (surprisngly, one of the few sexual acts not appearing in the film).God knows what the actors thought they were getting themselves into, and I'm sure everyone went into it with their eyes wide open, but the whole thing just comes across as exploitive. In fact, if titilation's what you want, there's more entertainment in your average porn film, and it's cheaper.Michael Winterbottom will be forever remembered as the man who put the first cum shot in a mainstream British film and it could also possibly be a world first.

Instead he plays a boorish and unintelligent Tom Cruise. No panache, no style. Not enough attention is payed to Miranda Otto, who was so riveting in \"The Two Towers\" and \"The Return of the King\". The kids are irritation personified. It's as if Spielberg wanted to show the world how an invasion affected a stereotype of the common family. If this is the common family, we're in trouble. A father who doesn't deliver the necessary skills to his children, or give them expectations to achieve; kids who don't pay attention to authority figures; a crazy Tim Robbins whose character's actions, and final outcome, are pointless to moving us through the story. There wasn't enough horror in this flick. Here we have a filmmaker who has redefined what can be done with film, i.e \"Jaws\" and \"Schindler's List\", who has a chance to do it yet again with a classic story of alien invasion, to truly scare us and make us think, and instead, we get tripe. No spoiling here unless I'm not opaque enough, but there is such a cop out, a deus ex machina, in the end of the movie that my impression was that Spielberg mistakenly assumed that the movie was horrific enough for the viewer to that point.

It actually serves as a notable turning point as it is the first in a string of Technicolor melodramas Sirk helmed at Universal-International, as well as one of his most popular. It also kick-started the malnourished career of Rock Hudson and sent his fame into another realm. Despite the film's lame-brained premise and endless implausibilities, Sirk takes the material and dishes out a sweet, moving drama that is a thinly disguised tale of Christianity.Hudson stars as Bob Merrick, a millionaire playboy with no cares in the world. His lavish and self-serving lifestyle inadvertently leads to the death of a prominent local doctor, Wayne Phillips. Dr.Phillip's widow, Helen(Jane Wyman)tries to pick up the pieces of her shattered life, while at the same time resisting the advances of Bob Merrick. His persistence results in an accident in which Helen goes blind. In a convoluted and corny twist, Bob tries to redeem himself by giving selflessly to others and devoting his life to medicine to find a way to restore Helen's eyesight.Every stereotype of every soap opera convention is used in overwhelming doses to tell the story of \"Magnificent Obsession\". The \"alternative lifestyle\" of Christianity that Bob learns is a mish-mash of psychobabble that even the most detail-oriented viewer would find boring and confusing. And the seriousness in which the actors take the material is eye-rollingly unbelievable. But this film is saved by the always-savvy direction of Douglas Sirk(who himself hated the plot)and an elegant, understated Jane Wyman who brought her own brand of sophistication to every role she played - and was Oscar-nominated for this role. Even Hudson is able to overcome his nerves in his first leading, A-list role to give a performance that is convincing. Sirk's use of reflective surfaces and a dominating color palette give this movie a look that is undeniably sheen. And Frank Skinner's classical score takes the ordinary material to an emotional level; although the choral \"oohs and aahs\" on the soundtrack are a bit pungent for such a quiet film. This is not Sirk's best work, but it is definitely solid enough to engage first time viewers and a must for fans of the German-bred director's work.</td><td>rw1134570</td><td>The Glossy Facade Gives Way To A Studio Classic</td><td>Michael27-1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(30, 38)</td><td>Unfaithfully Yours (1948)</td><td>10</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>Though he directed a few more movies over the years, Unfaithfully Yours was the last great hurrah from one of Hollywood's greatest comedy writer-directors, Preston Sturges. But Lawdy, what a way to go out.The movie stars Rex Harrison in what might be seen as a kinder, gentler cousin of his egomaniacal diction professor in My Fair Lady (1964). Here, Harrison is Sir Alfred de Carter, a world-renowned symphony conductor who is still astoundingly infatuated with the woman he refers to as his \"bride,\" Daphne (charming Linda Darnell). The movie never declares how long or short of a time the Carters have been married, but judging from their passion level, one would guess they're still in the honeymooning stage.(The far more down-to-earth married couple, Alfred's in-laws August and Barbara, are portrayed wonderfully by Rudy Vallee and Barbara Lawrence. Barbara gets all the great barbs off against her husband, who is only to happy to show his ignorance of them.) One day, August accosts Alfred with the unfortunate news that he paid a detective to tail Daphne while Alfred was out of town. Alfred is so convinced of his wife's fidelity that his reaction starts at outrage and goes haywire from there. Little by little, though, Alfred is given reason to think that Daphne might have needed some spying-on after all. At his concert that evening, Alfred conducts three pieces by Rossini, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner, and with each piece, Alfred imagines the stylish revenge he will extract upon Daphne for her presumed cheating.From this sober-sounding scenario, Sturges--as he always did--goes all over the place, from sparkling dialogue to skittering slapstick to rich drenches of sentiment. And the melange has never worked better than it does here. Just for kicks, take three of the movie's set-pieces: Alfred's achingly funny dressing-down of August for siccing a detective on Daphne, the first fantasy where Alfred hatches an elaborate murder scheme, and Alfred's drunken attempt to carry out the scheme. Three scenes of complete different tones, and they all plausibly fit into the same movie. Now try to imagine any modern-day comedy-maker whose work would display the wit of any of those scenes.The Criterion Collection DVD of the movie does it full justice. It includes a seemingly irrelevant but nonetheless enjoyable critique of Sturges' work from Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones. And an interview with Sturges' widow Sandy, as well as copies of voluminous memoes to Sturges from uncredited producer Darryl Zanuck, demonstrate why the movie was initially a colossal box-office failure. Zanuck hounded Sturges to the point that the gifted creator of (to name but two) The Palm Beach Story and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek began doubting himself as a writer, resulting in the final humiliation of Zanuck cutting the film on his own. Then a timely scandal involving Rex Harrison forever killed the box-office chances of a black comedy starring Harrison as an ostensible woman-murderer.Happily, Unfaithfully Yours, like Chaplin's similarly dark Monsieur Verdoux, survived its prudish times and has become renowned as a great movie. Alfred's take on Delius might be delirious (as professed by one of his fans, played by the great Sturges alumnus Edgar Kennedy)...but Sturges himself remains stupendous.</td><td>rw1134571</td><td>A great symphony of a comedy</td><td>steve-bailey-1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(0, 1)</td><td>Universal Soldier: The Return (1999)</td><td>3</td><td>23 July 2005</td><td>This is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller.

Street-fighting between Communists and reactionaries is chronicled, explicating the German populace's understandable desire for law and order.Local operation of the Gestapo, the surprisingly low count of actual employees and the extent to which surveillance by neighbors led to non-conformant citizens' denunciation and imprisonment is illustrated through a brief look at a case in Nürnberg. The informant who sent her innocent neighbor to die in a camp is interviewed.The Wild East chapter illustrates the great variance in regional Nazi commanders' approach to Germanization of Poland and how Hitler's management style facilitated bureaucratic fiefdoms.Too often documentaries demonize the Nazis and assume individuals somehow sprang fully formed from the gates of hell.

I first saw it as a kid on late night TV around 1970 and it did scare the *bleep* outta me. The most lasting image is the monster grabbing one of the hapless humans and killing him with a flurry of monstrous swipes; I knew from a statement in a previous scene that every bone in this guy's body had just been broken. The film did a good job of setting up all the characters, as each was distinguishable, and you begin to fear for each individual, not just a faceless group. The creature itself was the stuff of every 10-year old's nightmare, an indestructible freakazoid which would have another Creature (from the Black Lagoon) for lunch easily. Adults, of course, pass it off as a man in a suit, but I think most of these tough guys, if they ran into this thing in the dark, would not be looking for a zipper - they'd be trying to scale an unclimbable wall. The setting for this type of scare flic is brilliant: a haunted house in outer space, with no place to go (well, according to this, you can leave temporarily if you have a spacesuit). The template for this was later used in Alien(79), but I always felt the ship in that film was TOO Big; there would always be, it seemed, some nook or cranny for Ripley to hide in and she blew up that ship prematurely. Here, the crew runs out of room quickly; there's nothing left to do in the end except wait a few more minutes for the big ugly monster to kill you.

What's amazing is that with all the hefty boy girl and brother stuff going on, the deepest, most moving part of the film is the love between Wyatt and Doc. As a matter of fact, even Wyatt's seeking the love of his life seems just to be the legitimate expression of his love for Doc. Val Kilmer's Doc is Bob Dylan finally showing up in the Old West -- ironic, laconic, fragile, and lovable...and just too cool for words. What satisfies in this film is that everyone in this film is over the top macho, in the most positive sense of the word. The cowboys are macho-ly bad guys, the brothers are macho-ly brothers, the wives are macho-ly wives, the actress is macho-ly woman, the coward is macho-ly cowardly, and the suggested gay actor is macho-ly suggestedly gay. Yes, and Doc is macho-ly a scholarly, poetic, out-of place and time, sensitive artist of a killer.

Simply put, this TV version is a Navy garbage scow filled to overflowing with every manner of rotting refuse.Everything about this production stinks to the high heavens. The inexplicably rewritten and mangled script makes little sense from one scene to the next, much less as a whole. There is no magic, no romance, no wartime nostalgia, no, well, writing. The magnificent score, arguably Broadway's greatest, is watered down to near-Muzak levels, and is at times barely recognizable.Glen Close is a fine singer, but does little of interest with a lapful of jewels. The other principals appear apologetic for forcing people to put up with their singing IN A MUSICAL.The only bright spots were when the chorus, both the sailors and the nurses, sang. They had little worthwhile to do, but, boy, could they sing! I suspect the choral numbers were recorded by professional singers and lip-synched by the actors since the sound, particularly the soloists, was most unlike what one hears onstage anymore.If this had opened on Broadway in 1949, it would have died a quick and painful death within a week, and SOUTH PACIFIC would have been lost to the ages. And this abominable remake is equal to the other ABC/Disney tragedies of recent years--ANNIE, Cinderella and particularly THE MUSIC MAN, the second worst offender of the lot. They are to be avoided at all cost. Under no circumstances should anyone ever waste time watching these horror shows. I am certain their creators are rolling in their graves at their existence.

I never found myself sympathizing with the main characters, but I still thought that they were (for the most part) well performed.But that's about it for what was good about this movie. I'm not even going to touch the blatant Jaws rip-off at the alligator farm. The primary antagonist was Flat Dog, a gigantic crocodile (and when I say gigantic, I mean think she was actually a prehistoric crocodile, rather than a Nile crocodile as the movie claimed) who apparently had the ability to jump like a dolphin and charge like a rhinoceros. Some bozos smash her eggs, so she gets angry and goes on a killing spree. I never thought I'd say this about a horror movie, but I think I preferred the CGI croc (used whenever we saw her in her entirety) over the animatronic (used when we only saw her head). That's not to say the CGI was particularly realistic, however. Flat Dog wouldn't have looked out of place in an episode of Animal Face-Off (if you've ever seen the show, you'll know what I mean).I won't go into any depth about any of the characters' deaths, but the first major one to die is counter-intuitive to everything horror deaths should be (not to mention what actually happens if you're attacked by a crocodile). To be scary, a death needs to be painful and drawn-out. As the guy who created Leatherface, Tobe Hooper should've known this.This movie tried so hard to be Jaws.

The fact about where she ends up is clear from the outset as we see her frozen body lying in a ditch and the film attempts to piece together what brought her to her sad ending.18-year-old Mona Bergeron (Sandrine Bonnaire) is infuriating and largely unlikable, but the film does not judge her actions or lifestyle and Varda offers no explanations, psychological insights, or admonitions to society, there is just Mona - a spunky but deeply troubled young woman. On the surface she is a free spirit. She smokes a lot of cigarettes and pot, drinks cheap booze, and enjoys the company of men, but it is clear that there is a lot going on beneath - some untold story, perhaps a rejection from a member of her family or a boyfriend, an event that has instilled confusion and self-loathing, but we never find out. Like Charles in Bresson's The Devil Probably, Mona turns her anger inward without recognizing a problem, much less attempting to find its source and the film becomes one long suicide watch.Little by little we find out bits and pieces of information about Mona through interviews and recreated flashbacks but they do not add up to much. We learn that she comes from a middle class family, she has employable skills but there is no answer as to why she has dropped out of life, tuning out everything and everyone except the open road. Angry and self-righteous yet strangely passive, Mona drifts from one encounter to another without connection, commitment, or joy. She meets a college professor, a tree agronomist looking into the diseases that kill plants, a Turkish migrant worker who wants her to stay until his fellow workers reject the idea, a goat-herding intellectual who offers her a piece of land to cultivate, and a wealthy old woman who needs a companion.The reactions of the participants help us to create a picture but we learn more about the witnesses than about Mona. Each person reacts to her in a different way, and some romanticize her out of all proportion to reality. A young girl helps her fill her water bottle at the farm and later tells her parents that she wants to be free like that girl. Yolande, the maid at the old woman's estate, feels that Mona's relationship with a fellow drifter is her idea of true love. Some offer her a way out but she will have none of it. She prefers the road with its adventure and uncertainty. The farmer disappointedly says: \"It's not wandering, it's withering.\" One of the best scenes is when she gets drunk with the old woman who knows everyone is waiting for her to die. Both have a moment of laughter but it is only a mask for world-weariness and will not hold off the night, encroaching like a thief. In a truly accomplished performance, Ms. Bonnaire creates a memorable character that forces us to bear witness to our own humanity. As one powerful moment blends into another, she forces us to see a face behind the statistics we see each day in the newspaper and to look this woman in the eye knowing that she is a part of us, perhaps the part that we would rather not see. Mona is not a person I would particularly care to meet, but I also know that she is one that I cannot ignore or ever forget.</td><td>rw1134583</td><td>Forces us to bear witness to our own humanity</td><td>howard.schumann</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 5)</td><td>Cube (1997)</td><td>1</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>The idea of this movie was fantastic.

Depp is funny but lightweight and the movie is very very set bound and looks and feels artificial which may have been the point but it would have been far creepier if shot on actual fog bound locations. Instead of being scary the gore just becomes tedious and in the end I found myself fast forwarding to the resolution. Burton followed this with Mars Attacks also terrible and Planet of the Apes which is perhaps the worst remake of all time.

Divided into ten segments plus a prologue and epilogue, the title is derived from a minuet-like dance for two people commonly performed at court during the 17th and 18th centuries. Like the dance, there are never more than two people on screen at any one time and the film is almost all conversation with bits of classical music. The film is vintage Bergman with revealing close-ups, emotionally intense dialogue, an old-fashioned style of film-making, and a surfeit of bitterness about the human condition.Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson, the original screen couple from Bergman's 1973 film Scenes of a Marriage, reunite in his summer home for their first face to face contact since their breakup. Johan has become very wealthy as a result of an inheritance. Marianne is a lawyer and they have two daughters from their failed marriage: Sara who is married to a prominent lawyer and lives in Australia and Martha who is in a mental institution and does not recognize her mother. Johan is surprised by his ex-wife's visit but they still hold hands and try to remember the good things about the past, though Johan's interest seems to be minimal. Living nearby are Henrik (Borje Ahlstedt), Johan's son from a second marriage and his daughter Karin (Julia Dufvenius), a promising young cellist. Henrik and Karin have an uncomfortably strong attachment and mutual need as a result of the recent death of Anna, Henrik's wife who was deeply loved.Henrik is training his daughter in the cello to prepare her for an audition at the local conservatory but has to turn to Johan for financial support who uses the occasion to humiliate him. Karin is contemplating going to Europe to work for an orchestra but is afraid of the consequences for Henrik if she leaves. Relationships between the family are strained, seemingly beyond repair and their world is filled with childish resentments and regrets. Karin resents her father for suffocating her emotionally. Marianne still resents Johan for his unfaithfulness. Henrik resents his father for -- not being a father. Johan resents Henrik for not being the son he wanted. No one can see beyond their ego to feel the needs and wants of others. The emotional pain is real but I found the end result to be facile and unconvincing.Saraband has received high praise as a \"lacerating examination of life's conundrums that is exhilarating in its fearlessness and its command\", and an \"affective, touching, and ultimately highly affirming picture of familial turmoil and the curative, as well as destructive, powers of love.\" But what I ask is this - What new insights do we gain about the human condition from witnessing a family go at each other with unbridled ruthlessness? In offering his audience the latest generation of \"emotional illiterates\", Bergman lets us see the clawing and fighting but hides the life-affirming reality that people are capable of transcending their limitations.In Saraband, there is no self- reflection, responsibility, or hint that people can change with the passage of time. His characters only seem to have been able to refine their capacity for collecting grievances. When Henrik is suffering, no one talks about him, goes to visit him, or seems in the least concerned. Is this the way Bergman after all these years sees human relationships? Is this the legacy he wants to leave us?

Hollywood can't seem to make a good scary movie any more. And the ending line was comical and several of us in the theatre actually laughed at the ludicrous statement made by Jennifer Connelly's character (I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie yet by explaining the last scene).Speaking of Hollywood, what is it with the cookie-cutter movies? It's always the same: ghost of a child talks/threatens the living child/family in the story and the adults walk around not knowing what is going on until the end when the body or the truth is found out.

The film has some strong moments, particularly in the last half-hour, but is undone by amateurish acting, exaggerated sentimentality, and the banal songs of British folk singer Donovan. Francesco is the son of a wealthy textile merchant. He has indulged in the good life in his youth but when he comes back seriously ill from fighting a local war his attitude towards life changes. He loves watching the birds, communing with nature, washing lepers, and helping the poor. He hears the message from the cross of a church that has been destroyed to \"go and rebuild my church\". Turning from his father's greedy ways, he renounces all his possessions and follows his ideal of Christ to live in simplicity and poverty. After one of his followers is killed, however, he goes to Rome to find out what he is doing wrong and, after much hesitation, receives the blessing of Pope Innocent III who is played by Alec Guinness in the only scene in the film that has any real emotional depth. Graham Faulkner is unconvincing as Francesco, playing the would-be saint with all the gob stopping goodness and wide-eyed conviction of Martin Short performing a routine on Saturday Night Live. He is not helped much either by Judi Bowker as Clare, a young disciple who joins Francesco in running through the flowers or by Lee Montague in an hysterically overwrought performance as Francis' capitalist father. Zeffirelli depicts the young St. Francis as a stereotypical hippie rebelling against the sins of greed and materialism. Of course by the time of the film, the hippie movement had turned into a sordid scene of drugs and violence and the idealism of the flower children had largely been preempted by a voracious media that inevitably responds to new ideas with the position that if you can't beat 'em, embrace and emasculate them. I cannot argue with the need to return to a life of authenticity, a life of the spirit, but despite all its surface promotion of an open lifestyle, the film is a barely disguised attempt to bring all the unwashed hippies into the Christian fold. Nonetheless, Brother Sun, Sister Moon is a beautiful looking film that might have still worked if the director had simply followed the teachings of his protagonist and shown less ostentation and earnestness, more naturalism and simplicity, and more appreciation than exploitation.</td><td>rw1134596</td><td>Exaggerated sentimentality</td><td>howard.schumann</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>I alepou kai o boufos (1987–1988)</td><td>7</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Giorgos Konstadinou is a living legend of Greek TV.He made lots of TV-series and he was pioneer in comedy in Greek TV.I alepou kai o boufos was one of his best!It was very funny and maybe cult!Giorgos Konstadinou holds the major role and has for leading lady the beautiful young blond girl Tzovanna Fragouli.The chemistry between them is unique.That's why they cooperate again and again in the future.Dina Konsta and Kostas Palios are very good but the character that plays Markos Lezes is really cult!Markos Lezes is in his major role in his poor career in the TV.He is very funny.It is pity that Giorgos Konstadinou don't make any more good TV-series.</td><td>rw1134597</td><td>Classical Giorgos Konstadinou</td><td>anstamatopoulos</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(3, 4)</td><td>Lord Zedd's Monster Heads: The Greatest Villains of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (1995 Video)</td><td>2</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Well, this is an odd one.

After the more than slight letdown of CORPSES, I wasn't expecting to be blown away by REJECTS, I was just looking to be entertained. Now mind you I've had a mini poster for this film hanging in my office for weeks, I've been talking about the film with friends, and we all pretty much agreed that based on the trailer it looked like Rob had finally gotten his chops down(basically, I really wanted to like this picture). Having said all this, about half way through finally watching the picture, I looked over at my wife and told her that I was considering walking out on the film, something I never do. I didn't walk out, and I'm glad that I stayed because there were some parts towards the end that I thought were pretty well executed, but overall my general attitude towards the film was that I pretty much was embarrassed for Rob.The violence delivered, some of the performances did as well, and there were certainly some stand out scenes, but nothing was going to save this mess from the poor writing. Without going into spoilers, the Groucho/Elvis scene was SO BAD that I cringed and wondered to myself how someone was capable of not only writing such crap but then seeing it through filming and final edit and still not having the sense to cut it. We got you Rob, you did your homework on the Marx Brothers, and I get you were probably mad that some didn't catch your homage in the first film, but there is no excuse to add a scene like the one you just did. A. It made no sense and B. It did nothing for the story. That's not the only scene like that in the film either. The chicken scene, the ice cream scene, I could go on. It seems to me Rob really respects Tarantino, and who doesn't? But, he's not even close to being on level with him, so the previously mentioned scenes come off instead sounding as a poor imitator trying to write dialog that he believes will be memorable and good enough to carry a scene without moving the story along, i.e. Royale with cheese.I could keep going but I will cut it short. Bottom line, this was film school on a big budget and I mean this as no insult on the part of TALENTED filmmakers in film school. Rob you should stick to directing short subject music videos. You have style no doubt, but leave the writing to the people that can do it well. There are plenty of talented indie directors that deserve the budget and crew you work with and it's a shame. I hate being this harsh because I really give Rob credit for beating the odds and getting these films made, and anyone who is trying to help push the horror genre along is worth a look in my book, but this film in my opinion deserves every negative word it gets.One last word on the cast. Bill Moseley was fantastic, even given some of the unlikely dialog for his character(Mark Twain s***?). Leslie Easterbrook was the best of the crop(Karen who?). And William Forsythe was as good as expected. As for Sheri Moon Zombie, I'm glad Rob is proud of his wife's ass, but it seems to be becoming a plot point. Sheri you look great, which might be good enough to get you on an album cover, but please take a few acting lessons before trying the big screen again. And finally Sid was great, but much better in the first one.4 out of 10 stars. Wait for the rental.</td><td>rw1134601</td><td>I wanted to like it Rob...

But if you are going to do it, perhaps you should I dunno make it better?In the latest Hollywood misgivings about damn-to-hell-what-the-audience-wants-let's simply-recycle-a-hit-from-the-past-and-worry-about-the-conseque nces-later offering the result is a practically serviceable yet play-by-play 'safe' remaking of the comedy classic that starred the lovably gruff, messed-bed persona of the beleaguered Walter Matthau in all his schlumpy glory as the grizzled, beer-drinking never-was of a big-league ballplayer reduced to cleaning swimming pools in sunny Southern California musing about his one time only appearance in the majors while managing a ragtag little league ball team of misfits, losers and foul-language spewing tykes which unearthed a new sports themed subgenre: the pathetic team of misfits, losers and foul-language spewing tykes which have been seen in everything from THE MIGHTY DUCKS to the recent REBOUND with its pedestrian scripts and bathroom humor that has run stale since the original BEARS' first unworthy sequel!Well now indie cum Hollywood darling Richard Linklater (SCHOOL OF ROCK, DAZED AND CONFUSED) comes equipped with a faithful yet raunchy enough screenplay by BAD SANTA scribes Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who manage to update the Bill Lancaster script and Michael Ritchie's direction with enough pallid political incorrectness (except for one glaring omission in one of the lines spoken by the most foul player, Tanner Boyle (which I'm going to do likewise in fear of rebuttal; yeah, that's the times we live in folks, but dammit the line is funny and it's a JOKE!) and sexual humor to make the most hardened go-figure curmudgeon chuckle.Thornton fills Matthau's shoes as Morris Buttermaker, a drunken ex-ball player who is now an exterminator here but still a souse with a lousy demeanor, who is coerced by an attorney child-rights activist named Liz Whitehood (the sexy Harden) and an undisclosed check to coach the Bears, the worst team ever assembled (thanks to the political correctness we know have an Indian nerd and a chubby kid in a wheelchair rounding out the token black kid, two Mexican brothers and the fat kid whose on Atkins and not a junk food junkie).Buttermaker enlists the aid of Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kraft), a tweener pitching sensation he knew from his ill-fated relationship with her mom, when he realizes the kids really deserve more than the shellacking they received in their debut to the much-hated rivals, the Yankees led by Roy Bullock (Kinnear substituting yuppie weaseldom from Vic Morrow's gruff general bullying) who wants Buttermaker to take a hike.Also tacked on is grungy trouble making Kelly Leak (Jeff Davies) who Bullock can't stomach but proves to be a true athlete in power-hitting and displaying a keen touch for the outfield to boot as Buttermaker suddenly realizes the Bears may actually have a shot at the championship title.The film pretty much stays fast and loose but connect-the-dots similar to its original (even in an uncanny shot-by-shot of Leak's batting practice homer gliding into an actual game!) Not necessarily a bad thing but even though the screenwriters give Buttermaker a more active sexual life (sporting a bodacious babe here and there and even taking the kids to Hooters for a post-game celebration is inspired) it makes one wonder where it could've gone had they gone the R-rated route (which frankly the original came close to skirting as well). Thornton's sardonic Southern fried delivery is priceless  he's more chicken-fried steak than Matthau's salisbury and elicits enough contempt to distill the easily found treacle bubbling below (making the kids into winners) and Linklater, a personal fave of mine, seems to have found a unique niche: making kid films adult friendly.While it isn't an instant classic like the first flick  I blame that for the frankly carbon copies of the kids shown here  to wit, Tatum O'Neal actually emoted as Amanda in the '76 version! - (hell the Tanner kid looks and sounds just like the first one's! it's scary!) but they seem to be having a ball.

Sometimes to add something to the developing story, sometimes to create ambiguity about it. A storyline is revealed, just to be put in question in the next scene. The question can be posed if what we actually see (including the after-stories) in the end are the real stories, or are they also twisted like so many others. Is what we see the truth, or only a version of it? A person pretends to be another one (his brother), acting in a movie as an interpretation of him. A priest becomes a publisher's house agent once his life story is made to a script. A script is written and rewritten several times. The script is in contrast with other events going on.Pedro Almodóvar throws in some mild criticism of movies that try to sensationalize things in a cheap way.

It's stupid, amateurishly made, and mediocrely scripted. The little love story element makes no sense, isn't really built up to, yet that is one of the MINOR matters of this film. It must have been very low budget, too. They don't even bother to show a plane crash, instead simply showing it angled downward (by tilting the camera in a close-up) and then having it referred to afterwards as having crashed.Films compress time; I get that. But the lead actor repeatedly picking up the rocket-propelled-grenade launcher, which he had stolen from a bad-guy but without grabbing any accompanying supplies, without reloading it but magically new rockets kept appearing for him to shoot, one-at-a-time, until the last time he picks it up, it that time has not been reloaded, so he then says something like, \"Darn, out of ammo,\" is jarring. He pushes a jeep over a cliff with his truck but the bad guys don't bother to shoot at him until he's down the road, out of range.This resembles an elementary school play, written by kids themselves, with no goal other than to just get through it, not worrying about logic or entertainment along the way. A typical prairie fire has as much action as this flick, and watching the park service burn one off would be as entertaining as sitting through this, as at least then you know there's a future pay-off. The above no doubt sound like gags but I'm afraid they're true. Why do people who have so little film-making talent and so little interest in making something good go into this business? I agree exactly with the other comment about Haing Ngor but then say that we viewers should not consider stuff like this even simply acceptable time-killing material. This just plain stinks. The one thing I will say for the flick is that part of the ending was OK but those few seconds sure didn't make the rest of the viewing experience worthwhile. For that matter, another part of the ending was meant to be clever but it's something I'd seen and read as the \"twist\" in a bunch of other gold stories so had even predicted it.What's more, UPN repeatedly promoted this as \"starring Martin Sheen,\" only ever mentioning him at all, yet he's only in one per cent of it.

That's what you'll be doing at the back of the theater, your head slumped, your tongue hanging out, as you watch this week's Marvel-comic-book movie, \"Fantastic Four.\" FF was my favorite comic book back when I was a wee lad. These were Stan Lee's original superheroes with \"feet of clay\" (even before Spider-man). But the real heart of the comic was the Thing (Ben Grimm)--the big, tough wise guy with the big broken heart. And he is the one thing the movie got right--Michael Chiklis (and the impressive make up) capture the Thing perfectly.Unfortunately there are three other team members, who need to be \"developed\": Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), Sue Storm (the Invisible Girl, er, Woman), and Johnny Storm (the Human Torch). Ah, for the old comic-book origin story, where the four are shot up into space, are exposed to \"cosmic rays,\" crash back to earth, and immediately start manifesting their super powers. Before you know it, they're fighting the Mole Man (and sometimes each other).If only the movie had used such shorthand. Instead, well over half the flick is \"family\" bickering as the Four discover their abilities--and the origin of Dr. Doom (their greatest enemy) is outlined.Doom is the movie's most serious misstep. In the comic books, Doom was a scientist who falls from the \"pure faith\" (yes, \"he tampered in God's domain,\" to lift a bit from Ed Wood's \"Bride of the Monster\"). He had a regalness and grandeur about him, even as he tried to destroy the FF and take over the world (the perfect opposite of Reed). In the movie, Doom is another tiresome industrialist who (ala Norman \"Green Goblin\" Osborn) obtains super powers. His showdown with the FF at the end is somewhat less than epic (and the climax rips off a bit of \"Terminator 2\").The whole movie feels as though they shot a first-draft script (characters fairly trip over the loose ends, and Reed is about as much of a super genius as Wile E. Coyote).

This version's my favorite treasure-hunt-pirate movie, it ought to be on DVD just as it is, not colorized. I know, Beery's basically the same guy he played in most of his talkies. But someone at MGM had a flash of casting genius cuz Beery is the spittin' image of the Sea Cook in Winslow Homer's illustrations for the novel, and he wears the role like his favorite pair of--um--shoe. And even if the only English accents seem to come from Nigel Bruce (most prominently) and (who else? can't recall), somehow this cast makes their variety of UnitedStatesian accents work. They pull it off. There are a few differences between the novel and this movie version, but darn few and so what. There's no shortage of remakes & won't be. I'll take this version! Saw it on TV three or four times in my teen yrs, having read the novel when I was 12, and the differences were never significant to me. I've seen Disney's, which I liked on the Disneyland telecast, but, while Robert Newton is a definitive Long John Silver and the quintessential adventure-tale pirate--people today say Arrrr! because of his performance--Bobby Driscoll's Jim Hawkins never quite did the job in my opinion.

It has none of the flash nor special effects of today's summer blockbusters that are churned out by Hollywood's factories (such as the silly Will Smith \"Bad Boys\" flicks). No slow motion shots of the hero calmly walking towards the camera while stuff explodes real good behind him. What \"Cent jours a Palerme\" (French title) has is heart - a gritty, almost documentary feel that makes the violence in the film seem more \"real\" in a way than anything we've seen in the past several years.It also features Lino Ventura, one of the greatest actors from the 70's and 80's. Ventura was known for the hardboiled characters he used to play - usually police detectives. (He was a real life tough guy - started out as a wrestler.) The man always has a hard cold look in his eyes that hints at times of a fury hidden within; and other times great sadness. (\"Garde a vue\" is certainly one of his masterpieces.) In 100 Days in Palermo he plays a retired head of the Italian Federal Police who is sent to Sicily as a Prefect (a political appointed job with power to direct police investigations), for the purpose of taking on the Mafia - following a series of assassinations of judges and prosecutors. He's a man of great integrity and drive, which makes him likable. But he also suffers from some serious flaws, some of which I found maddening. But that also makes him a real person, which added to my appreciation of the character.Finally, this is one of the last great \"anti-Hollywood\" flicks with a \"realistic\" ending. No idiotic happy completion where the good guys win and the bad guys are blown away. In this sense, the film is very much a work from the 70's (even though it was made in the early 80's). Can you imagine a big studio production made nowadays with an ending like the ones in \"The Deer Hunter\" or \"Apocalypse Now\"? Not a chance. And this is not to say that this film in any way reaches the heights of the two aforementioned masterpieces - it certainly does not - but I'm simply making a point.It's not the absolute best of its genre, but nevertheless is well worth viewing, especially if you enjoy the European style political paranoia and pessimism of the 70's.</td><td>rw1134617</td><td>Anti-Hollywood thriller</td><td>Billygoat</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(6, 15)</td><td>3-Iron (2004)</td><td>5</td><td>24 July 2005</td><td>I just got back from seeing 3-Iron.

Bin-jip is an intriguing premise generally lacking a story to serve as a vehicle for the premise. To the extent there is a story, it's largely a didactic one of juxtaposition between two men -- one compassionate and flawed, one evil, to the point of straw-man bad guy. On another level, the film is an \"exotic\" journey into the world of the obscure, with hopelessly abstract (though uninteresting) characters. I'm a fan of art cinema, and I generally eschew the dogma that cinema necessarily requires dramatic conflict. So, in the hands of the right director, film as conceptual art works for me. Unfortunately, either Kim ki-duk is not that director, or Bin-jip is not that film.

That's correct: 170,000,000 people were murdered by their own governments; in most cases, the victims had no power to defend themselves.Most people have heard of the Nazi Holocaust -- but few know much about the massive genocides of Soviet Russia, China, Cambodia, Uganda and Guatemala. Only because of the recent film, Hotel Rwanda, do more people know about the calculated mass murder there -- Innocents Betrayed came out 2 years before Hotel Rwanda! The second half of the film shifts focus from the world's genocides to the American experience with citizen powerlessness. Viewers may be quite surprised ... I won't give it away.Innocents Betrayed includes a lot of still photo and video materials, and enough facts and figures to prove its point. This is not a stodgy \"educational video\" by any means -- the stories move steadily with appropriate voice-over and music, so that viewers can follow them.

Now it's up to this group of people to figure a way to get off the island or they shall meet an unpleasant demise from hordes of zombies.So, this is \"House of the dead\" and I just got to say it was just woefully incompetent schlock. I guess my curiosity just got the better of me when I saw it was playing on TV. While watching it, I thought it was on the music channel at times, as it mainly felt like an over-extended music clip. Director Uwe Boll's film is nothing but pretentious garbage and an incredibly lousy effort. It really has nothing going for it well, it did have nice island scenery and fair makeup effects and a good amount of blood and gore. But these things couldn't carry this plain dreadful film. On show are paper-thin material and unlikeable characters. The actual lacklustre plot fails logic, it's filled with yawn inducing clichés, even the back-story of these zombies is poorly setup and it ends with a diabolical finale. Though, what it sorely missed was humour! But then again it probably thought it was funny, but I just didn't see it. It felt like the film was actually taking itself rather serious and if so, well there you go. The performances are either wooden or atrocious and the characters are mundane and annoying. You just don't care for these hoons. There's even a young Bruce Campbell look alike, but he doesn't have the charisma or talent of that great actor. The dialogue is rather mindless drivel, which is filled with bad puns and mind numbing lines. It's nothing but tripe and stereotypical circumstances.The direction is just a muddle. Boll was trying too hard to make his film super coooool. Instead he lacked imagination in his execution, therefore making it super dull and uneventful. What else didn't help was the dumb editing of sequences of the actual video game to cut to new scenes. The score was mostly nonexistent, but not the damn techno soundtrack that pop up during the action scenes my ears!!! It was just too much. When the techno music kicked in, so did the flashy camera-work that also got on my nerves. With its 360 degrees camera shots and shaky panning. Though, it was the slow-mows, which Boll centred on and really, it was not needed. It was just too distracting and rather lame. These action set pieces went on for far too long, which made it feel like everything was in slow-mow. What didn't help these moments was that no tension was generated and the action was mainly unexciting and pedestrian. No scares or thrills are evident. The romance sequences were just odd and rather laughable, with some characters finding love while battling zombies. A lot moments became a real drag because they dwelled on nothingness and too many sequences became really repetitive e.g. too many save yourself scenarios and a lot chasing about I mean a lot! Some shots were actually used over and over again. Yes, this is a pointless and unsatisfying mess of a production. After seeing this film you'll be thinking what the hell was that?

It was two years in the making for director Juraj Jakubisko. The story is based on the prophesies of Nostradomus, that's why it takes place in a non existent time. At first I though I was watching a time piece film, but later you see a motorcycle, helicopters and men in contamination suits. Some of the costumes of the film are strange looking, especially if your not familiar with European culture. There is Czech folk outfits, men with feather hats and other strange gypsy like clothes. Don't let the outfits distract you, because the film is simply amazing. The beginning is disturbing as the village is massacred by wolves after a wedding. Even a baby and children fall victim. The musical score was so powerful, that this scene haunted me long after it was over.In the attack, a man named Goran saves a baby, Verona the mother promises him the daughters hand in marriage when she gets older. Then the movie goes ten years into the future. A circus comes to town and becomes a slight disruption for the village. There's a crazy cast of Felliniesque circus freaks. There's an 8 foot tall lady, a midget and even a monkey. The film even includes a kiss between the the midget and monkey. Weird huh? Finally the film goes further in the future by ten years, but the environment looks the same. Goran finally marries the girl, because she is now twenty. But Goran still has feelings for the girls mother. So the situation turns into a folk gypsy Jerry Springer style drama, except without the trailer court.

She doesn't lose it with decorous resignation, as she did in familiar masterpieces by Wong Kar-Wai and Stanley Kwan. Instead, she insults and jostles her way to the bottom, ditching the reticence that constrained her in nearly every other film she's made.Seldom heard until now, her clipped British English is underscored at first by breakneck speech-rhythms, cadences en route to a crackup: these telegraph the destructive impatience of her character. A procession of gas stations, wheezing old cars and stained Formica desks follows, terminating in contracts signed with descending water-spray scribbles. The Eno-dependent score draws on _Another Green World_, the visuals, _Paris, Texas_. Her heroin/death crash gives way to temporary calm, which is jostled into verbal violence again after her character moves to Paris. That setting is where her character seems most natural and believable: berating and brushing away friends in a culture peculiarly disposed to viewing argumentativeness as courage and social dysfunction as passion.Chung's addict isn't always N.A.-accurate, but her delineation of the role she was asked to play borders on virtuosic. Much as one loves seeing Chung embody the perfect suffering torch-song icon in films like Center Stage and In the Mood for Love, it is thrilling to hear her claim other languages, styles and emotional idioms as her own. Even her singing is antithetical to the voice of her earlier characters. And it isn't an accident that she is cast against a restrained Nick Nolte, who portrayed a raging drunk so affectingly in _Affliction_, and a complacent bohemian Béatrice Dalle, whose superficially flawed gap-toothed beauty and eccentric portrayals have provided temporary pleasure in so many dystopian films.Despite Clean's hoary conceit -- heroin weaning as spiritual redemption -- the cinematography is beautiful and evocative, particularly the landscape pans. As in Drugstore Cowboy, one feels the drugs and the music to be an arbitrary pretext for a film that is actually about something else.The music references are embarrassing. Particularly wince-making are repeated references to Mazzy Star, since that's who Chung's character is intended to resemble (could the director have been more obvious?). The model isn't surprising, given Chung's orientation: One way to get a convincing performance out of a non-singer is to develop a character voice -- in this case, something deadpan and breathy, with almost no vibrato. Even so, the director's lack of finesse is revealed insofar as Mazzy Star's name is mentioned at all -- let alone repeated and underlined by two different characters.Chung plays a vintage failed rock singer well in the San Francisco studio, with her careless beaten unbranded leather, AKG K-240 headphones, Neumann TLM-103 caged mike, pop filter (though she doesn't need one) and groggy swaying motion. Even so, it's Chung's mastery of her character's pacing that seems most musical, not the voice she musters or the blues dirge she happens to sing. One wonders what Nicholas Roeg would have to say about her, um, performance.As always with Chung, the emotional repression of the character is what makes her breakdown so affecting. In work that is elegiac, one always wants the tears to come slowly: talking oneself out of them, bracing oneself, is what forces emotion to surface in the end.</td><td>rw1134623</td><td>In the Mood for a Virtuosic Performance</td><td>scrypt@rcn.com</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(3, 5)</td><td>Der Philosoph (1989)</td><td>8</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Hardly an erotic film, but then real sex is often something different from 'sexy' (and rather better).The plot is that an academic and socially inept philosophy student who is working on his thesis meets an attractive woman who may or may not be imaginary.The woman is not only attractive, she has a personality. (How often do you see that in a film like this?). The philosopher and the woman become friends and then begin to have sex. (Not the way round things happen in most erotic films). He then meets her two friends who share her apartment, and when he has grown close to them, has sex with each of them in turn (and various other permutations).The film shows a fair amount of flesh, but it has the undriven and exploratory quality of narrative of a real drama. One would need to be extremely blunt to manage to get through any sequence of this film without thinking about what is happening on-screen.As with very few films (and hardly any English-language ones) this is a film about sex without being in any expected sense an erotic film.I enjoy it more every time I watch it.

They both hurt like crazy, it's just that one probably isn't as painful as the other. DON'T GO IN THE WOODS appears to be the retarded, illegitimate offspring of James C.Wasson's quietly unsettling NIGHT OF THE DEMON and the underrated JUST BEFORE DAWN. It's the simple story of a group of happy campers (including a bunch of whiny teens, a birdwatcher who looks like an old silent movie actor, a cripple who looks like Franklin from THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, a female artist and her baby daughter, two bone-chillingly unattractive newlyweds and...you get the idea) whose weekend in the Utah wilderness is rudely interrupted by a bloodthirsty maniac who looks and sounds like Long John Silver gone native and kills people for kicks. And that's it. There's no real plot, not a scrap of characterization, no structure, no dynamic, in fact nothing to compel or even mildly interest the viewer, just endless scenes of these hapless non-actors wandering through the forest and getting killed in various unlikely ways, with blood-drenched murder scenes that resemble Monty Python's memorable spoof of Sam Peckinpah, only done on a smaller budget. As a substitute for any on-screen suspense or drama, the belching, clanking, burbling synthesizer score by H.Kingsley Thurber (love that name!) plays throughout the entire film with no let-up. I'm not joking, it doesn't stop until the end credits when we get to hear him sing an inane ditty about the murderer to the tune of 'The Teddy Bear's Picnic'! Most of the dialogue seems to have been endlessly redubbed and rearranged, which gives the proceedings a surreal, ethereal feel, and the direction and editing are not so much undisciplined as wilfully perverse - it's as if Bryan tore up the entry-level director's handbook on day one, set out to break all the rules and succeeded unequivocally. It would be churlish to point out that the budget was obviously miniscule, since wonders can be worked for a handful of change - see LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, for example - but the budget for this Z-grade splatterfest would appear to have come from the pockets of sleeping gutterbums. As a further point of interest, this film remains banned in the UK, though I can't imagine any sensible distributor paying the censors to watch this nonsense in order to receive an 18 certificate.

It is 1913 and the Danes smell war in the air - though they are uncertain whether it will involve them or not.The film falls very oddly between being a not-very-interesting sex-comedy (all the women seem anxious to get laid, but we see very little except copious lingerie from any of them) and a much more intriguing montage of village life reacting to imminent war with a mixture of confusion and indifference.One could certainly watch the film without any attention to the erotic element. Sytten contains one of the few accurate loss-of-virginity scenes before Catherine Breillat, but all the rest of the porn is so anodyne as to be tedious. The photography of Nybro is lovingly attentive to detail though, and the attempt to capture belle epoque class certainty and political confusion if genuinely thought provoking.I thought this was a very good film, though I can see why it will disappoint almost everyone who watches it. The erotic content is either silly or annoyingly accurate (the people who watch erotic films seldom have any interest in real sex) but it certainly gets in the way of the rather unusual gentle nostalgia which should have been the film's forte.The other films I've seen from Anneliese Meineche were all just as confused.</td><td>rw1134626</td><td>Eh?</td><td>garwy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 4)</td><td>War of the Worlds (2005)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>War of the worlds is one of my favorite movie.

But the performance and the writing and direction lift this work out of 'the theater of the absurd' where I might have been able to laugh at it, into a 'realism' that transformed even the generous helpings of comedic irony into a growing pile of acute and sorrowful evidences of just how pathetic the main character had become.If you enjoy very dark humor, good acting for acting's own sake, or have a fascination with insanity, you might enjoy this film.This film might be valuable for discussing insanity, the depravity/corruptibility of man, or the fragility of the human psyche.</td><td>rw1134630</td><td>Not an enjoyable film</td><td>ollwen</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 7)</td><td>I girasoli (1970)</td><td>null</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>So many reviews talk of the beauty of this film, but you can't see it on the horribly transferred DVD I saw from Netflix last weekend. So much of the color has been drained from the source, and you'd thought the movie was shot in experimental color in 1939 instead of 1970. Shame on the quick-buck types who have violated De Sica's original film. It's simply awful to watch. I had never seen this emotional film about an Italian couple who marry on the eve of his being sent to the Russian front. He never returns, and she never gives up hope of his return. The Loren/Mastroianni pairing has always been potent on the screen. And it is so here with Loren utterly magnificent as the loving wife and the grief-struck and abandoned woman later on. When the wife travels to Russia to find him years after the war, she's much older, and her life has been ruined. So the scene where she finally is connected to him through his Russian wife, and then sees him arriving at the local train station, is truly heartbreaking. While he has committed himself to his new life in Russia, marrying another woman and father two children, Loren's face shows her disappointment and overwhelming sense of sadness as she finally see that all that this woman has is now denied to her. Mastroianni has a bothersome role here. It is Loren who initially proposes they marry at the beginning of the film. He's just another callow fellow having a fling before he goes off to war. Later when he's nearly dead from walking through the frozen Russian winter, in retreat and trying to get back to Italy, his character finally gives up and falls down in the snow to die. He is saved by a beautiful Russian girl who drags him back to civilization. I guess, grateful for her ministrations, he eventually marries her and settles into a new life in Russia. So the character is rather passive to begin with, robbing Mastroianni of his usual comic bombast. In the end, you wonder why waste these two screen giants on this weeper of a movie. I have always adored Loren. Besides her jaw-dropping beauty, she always projected such warmth, generosity of spirit, a sense of fun, and when called for, she could be as great playing tragedy as any screen actress of any generation. TWO WOMEN proved that, and films such as A SPECIAL DAY and Marriage Italian STYLE only underlined the marvelous acting skills she possessed. So it's disappointing to see her giving her usual great self to a property that isn't quite worthy of her. It's worth seeing for two stars who can elevate any material they've been given, but wait for a better DVD remastering.

In this absorbing drama, which is only one book of a monumental Catholic work by Marcia Davenport, Greer Garson plays a pretty and bright young woman who takes a job in the lavish home of a Pittsburgh steel magnate, played honestly and strongly veteran actor Donald Crisp. Gregory Peck plays one of his sons, the serious one, who is devoted to his father's mill and who works alongside some of the mill workers, including his friend Preston Foster. The father has two other sons--Dan Duryea, who is more desirous of having money rather than of working; and Marshall Thompson, who has turned to alcohol in his unhappiness...There is also a daughter played by the fine actress Marsha Hunt, perhaps one of her best performances. Gladys Cooper plays the matriarch of the family, who befriends Garson, and leaves her her shares in the mill. Garson's father, played with skill by Lionel Barrymore, is an embittered man, who lost the use of his legs in an accident in the mill, and did not want his daughter working for the owners. It is he who begets violence that has tragic consequences. Jessica Tandy plays Peck's wife, a bitter woman; Peck should have married Garsop all along, of course; but the climax of the film is the troubles at the steel mill that are started by the angry workers and the consequences on all concerned of this violent crisis action. There are many finely-developed characters in this long film, but I sense also a fair sense of fatality about the events, intended by the author, against which the attraction of persons, characters and dispositions of Peck and Garson are played, like two rays of sunlight illuminating a dark jungle's zone. Thiis attractive B/W production was directed by Tay Garnett. Marcia Davenport long novel was adapted to the screen by fine scenarist Sonya Levien and John Meehan. The cinematography for the film was the work of Joseph Ruttenberg and Herbert Stothart composed the dramatic score. When I say that the art direction was done by Cedric Gibbons with Paul Groesse, the set decorations by Edwin B. Willis and the costume designs by Irene, I have accounted for the film's very-opulent and vivid production values. In the cast apart from the principals already mentioned, one can see Barbara Everest, Geraldine Wall, Eveline Dockson, John Warburton, Rusell Hicks, Mary Lord, Arthur Shields, young Dean Stockwell, Maru Courier, Lumsden Hare, Connie Golchrist and Anna Q. Nilsson. This is always an attractive and a carefully-considered production, which occasionally seems to me to lack warmth; with a great script, everyone concerned could perhaps have produced a masterpiece. With the one they had, the talents involved produced a memorable adventure that rises on occasion to first-rate dramatic heights. Not to be missed, perhaps.

If you open your eyes (and your heart) wide enough to allow yourself to become invested in these characters and their myriad of authentic, human flaws, you will be justly rewarded.Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) is severely depressed. She's a recovering alcoholic who's trying to get over the loss of her husband. In her lethargy she fails to get a bogus tax charge cleared from her record, and her house is seized and sold in whirlwind fashion. Lester, the deputy sheriff (Ron Eldard) in charge of evicting Kathy, feels for her plight and soon falls in love with her. Massoud Amir Behrani (Kingsley) is an ex-Iranian Air Force colonel who is practically working himself to death trying to provide for his family. He sees the house as an opportunity that he  and his family  desperately needs. Kathy wants her house back, but Behrani has done nothing wrong and refuses to sell it. The house is of vital importance to multiple parties, and none of them are willing to yield.\"The House of Sand and Fog\" is an utter masterpiece and a great tragedy. It doesn't take long to figure that out: only a little ways into the film you'll think to yourself, \"Oh, this can't end well.\" And it does not. Along the way, you'll witness very real people making very human mistakes: bad decisions that push the conflict to the point where lives are permanently shattered. The acting is simply flawless, and I think Ben Kingsley might very well be the greatest actor alive.One of the movie's greatest strengths is its sympathetic portrayal of BOTH sides. The movie is fair to both Kathy and Behrani, although initially I was not. While watching the movie, I was completely unsympathetic towards Kathy. She was irresponsible, illogical, and petulant. My opinion of her didn't start to soften until she hits rock bottom near the end of the film. Was my opinion of her started to change, I saw another point of the film: this entire situation could have been averted if either side took the time to consider the others' point of view.Yes, Kathy was irresponsible, but the root source of her problem was a government screw-up: something that wasn't her fault and never should have come about in the first place. Her lethargy and failure to get the problem resolved exacerbated the situation, unquestionably, but it wasn't the cause of the situation. It's certainly very easy to sit in your recliner and condemn her actions. But the tough route is to accept her as a flawed human being and feel sympathy for her poor decisions. The way this character acts is NOT unreasonable if you account for human emotion; having \"characters with flaws\" is not the same as having \"flawed characters.\"Kathy's problem also brings to light an interesting aspect in our civil governments: in America you are supposed to be innocent until proved guilty, but often life imitates the art in the movie, where the county pushes ahead like a steamroller, completely ruining Kathy before they even took a moment to stop and realize they had made a mistake (those who view this as a \"contrived\" plot hook have obviously never had extensive dealings with any form of government).One of the themes of the film is that it presents a battle between emotion and logic. Each side is equally valid, and sometime a balance is difficult to reach between the two. Kathy is emotion. Her emotional attachment to her family's house leads her to bad decision after bad decision. And really, how much more human can you get? Hasn't every single one of us, at some (several) point(s) in our life, allowed emotion to overrule our common sense? Haven't we all made decisions based almost solely on emotion that have ended up only making things worse?Behrani, on the other hand, is logic. He's ex-military. He's very rigid, very right-and-wrong, very black-and-white, very unyielding. He's not completely soulless  his family is obviously more important to him than anything in the world  but he's also not easily swayed by emotional entreaties. However, I still felt that Behrani and his family were the most sympathetic characters in the film, mainly because they weren't the ones making all the bad decisions that kept making things worse. They truly get swept up in a situation beyond their control.If there is a \"bad guy\" in the film, it's the sheriff, Lester. He's Emotion, part two, and again, he's not a terrible person, just someone who lets his emotions get the better of him and makes a series of poor decisions. He's a cop who's unhappy in his marriage and just looking for an excuse out of it. When he meets and falls in love with Kathy, not only does he see an easy way out of his marriage, but he takes it upon himself to be the knight in shining armor, the protector for her.The tension escalates until the situation comes to a head, naturally, and it is a stroke of the darkest irony that begins the denouement of the film: when Kathy reaches rock bottom it is the Behranis who save her, and it is this unexpected act of kindness that gets misunderstood and leads to the tragic conclusion. The end of the film has a one-two finishing punch that's as heartbreaking as just about any movie you're apt to see.But don't let that dissuade you: the ending is actually one of the movie's greatest strengths. \"The House of Sand and Fog\" doesn't try to insult the audience with a contrived, upbeat finish. The characters are real, flawed people making real, human decisions which lead to a unfortunate conclusion. Which leaves the movie with perhaps its final, harshest message: some of life's lessons are learned at a tremendous cost.</td><td>rw1134651</td><td>Masterpiece</td><td>Phantom Phan</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(9, 10)</td><td>Amon Saga (1986)</td><td>6</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>AMON SAGA (1986) is a sword-and-sorcery anime tale that runs 75 minutes. Amon, the hero of the piece, is reminiscent of Conan the Barbarian but has the long light hair and pretty features of a \"bishonen\" character. It's not clear where or when this is set although it has all the trappings of standard sword-and-sorcerymonsters, evil lord, castles, princess-in-distress, musclebound sidekick, crafty spy, wizened sorcerers, etc. An original touch here is the giant turtle on which the evil Lord Valhiss's kingdom and castle are situated. The turtle tromps slowly through the countryside, stopping to pick up mercenary warriors along the way, including our hero Amon who soon makes it his business to rescue Lichia, a princess from another kingdom held hostage so that Lord Valhiss can get a map showing the way to the Valley of Gold, where all the competing parties will eventually converge for the climactic confrontation.The storyline isn't terribly compelling since we don't really know what's at stake for the protagonists or what kind of world they're occupying. The best sword-and-sorcery anime, like the 1997 TV series \"Berserk,\" makes sure to ground the viewers in the geopolitical specifics of the setting. Sure, Amon and Lichia are sweet and endearing, but the only reason we'd like to see them get together is the fact that they're the only good-looking people in the entire piece. Amon is quite handsome and Lichia quite beautiful, with her long blue-green hair and slender, pale, delicate body, but it's not unreasonable to ask for more reason to root for them than that.The main reason to watch AMON SAGA is the artwork, including participation in the character design by renowned pop artist Yoshitaka Amano, who's designed video games and anime and done artwork for fantasy and graphic novels. Much of the artwork in AMON indeed resembles some of the best fantasy fiction illustration. We see many breathtaking landscapes and occasional multicolored magical effects. The character design is marked by that great 1980s anime look of bold lines, straightforward detail and bright colors. It's always eminently watchable, but one wishes the story was a little more interesting and the action a little rougher.</td><td>rw1134652</td><td>Beautiful design and artwork elevate routine anime adventure</td><td>BrianDanaCamp</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(5, 8)</td><td>Jaws: The Revenge (1987)</td><td>5</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Of course, it's not exactly \"Top 250\"-material either. But this movie isn't as bad as some people say. Regardless of that, I personally think that most people agree with me when I say that it's better than it's predecessor, \"Jaws 3\". There are several reasons to this. First, the action scenes are better in this one. I liked the surroundings better too. The Caribbean was a really great place to shoot a Jaws-movie. The story isn't very good, but I think it's nearly impossible to make a good story this late in the series. On the interesting side, Michael Caine is in this movie. Is there any movie at all that this man refuses to take part in? It doesn't look like it.</td><td>rw1134654</td><td>The \"Bottom 100\" at IMDb is not the right place for this movie</td><td>sveknu</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 2)</td><td>Swordfish (2001)</td><td>3</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>I didn't catch this one when it was out in the cinema but had seen the trailers for it back in the day and had heard good things about it so I checked it out on DVD the other day, but wasn't at all impressed with what I got for my buck.The basic premise for the plot is quite interesting: A very shady guy (played by Travolta) needs the services of a super hacker (Hugh Jackman) in order to gain access to and snatch a whopping amount of Dollars from highly suspect government accounts. It also has a fine cast  John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Vinnie Jones and Don Cheadle, and apparently a sizeable budget to throw at some furious action as well. All the ingredients are here for a fine flick, even a great one, if all the basic ingredients were tied together with a good and well-told story  but this is where it all goes down the drain for me.The basic premise is good, but way it is realised is very disappointing. The characters are all superficial beyond belief. Travolta's character is by far the best  a psycho who is nigh on impossible to get a read on. He is obviously nuts and does a great deal of bad things, but he appears to believe that he is working for the greater good  in his book, two wrongs seem very able to make a right. He has some fun lines and some of the dialogue is even mildly thought provoking. If every aspect of this movie were up to the standards of Travolta's acting and the realisation of the character he is playing this would indeed be an interesting flick, but this is where the fun stops.Hugh Jackman's character, for example, is almost as bad as Travolta's is good. Jackman's acting isn't to blame, but the way we get to view this character, his motivation and personality never really catches on with the viewer. I think we are supposed to root for him and his getting to be with his daughter, but because he is so superficially portrayed, we never really get to feel for him or his relationship with his daughter, and if things are put bluntly, this could just as well have been cut from the story altogether. The movie would have worked just as well, if not better, had Jackman been in it for the money alone and not for his daughter.The additional characters in the story are even more superficially portrayed. We never really get to look inside the head of any of the cop(s) who seem to be our basic good guys or the government suits who seem to be our basic bad guys. Why Cheadle's character or the bad senator even have names must be down to simple convenience of reference, rather than any desire to bring the viewer closer to them as characters. They could just as well remain nameless as they are totally generic and without any depth of character beyond a face and a name. The motivation and behaviour of all the side characters in this movie are pretty much nonexistent.And what if you aren't into characterisation and stuff like that? Is the action alone enough to get a slight kick out of the movie? Personally I don't think so. There really isn't a lot of it, and again, the execution of it isn't above par.To surmise, I was rather disappointed with the movie. If you look for a story-driven plot, you could well be frustrated by the lack of character depth and the way the story is put together and presented, and you are likely to be disappointed by the lack of plausibility that comes in the wake of the misgivings presented above. You will wonder, \"why did that guy do that\", \"why didn't he do that instead\" and \"why didn't we get to see what happened there\" far more often than you will enjoy an occasional fun comment, a good bit of action, or Halle Berry's fine bod.This could easily have been a worthwhile movie, if only the story was better put together and executed. But as it is, the most positive way I can describe it is as a below average action movie with a plot and characters that are totally neglected.3/10</td><td>rw1134655</td><td>Travolta and Halle Berry's fine bod fight a losing battle to make this a worthwhile flick.</td><td>DragonRyder</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(5, 20)</td><td>Hustle & Flow (2005)</td><td>1</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>I saw the movie this week and thought it was absolutely AWFUL !!!

It brought me back to the good old days before there was so called political correctness. This reminded of movies like Stripes, Trading Places, Vacation and Caddyshack. Great funny R-rated comedy. Some people have written that the movie is homophobic and unrealistic. These people need to lighten up - its a comedy and a straight man being hit on by a creepy gay guy while being tied to the bed is funny particularly when that straight guy is Vince Vaughn. The midnight rape/naked homo art show rant from Vaughn is hysterical along with the scene when they are hunting quail (I'm psyched!!! Let's go kills some birds). There are many other scenes that were also ridiculously funny.Sure the movie did not make sense at times, but it is a comedy - just enjoy it. My only gripe was that the movie was too long. It was about 2 hours and it seemed some of the stuff towards the end should have been cut out.

Then there is a crazy German scientist who is researching UFO's, who is interested in what's been happening. Anne Carlisle also plays a dual role as a nasty male model drug addict. \"Liquid Sky\" is very vulgar, psychedelic and surreal. Not to mention, the horrific acting makes it hilarious. It may very well be one of the strangest drug cult films of the 80's. It is also extremely colorful, weird and a must watch guilty pleasure.

The task of picking a movie was assigned to me. But seeing that I haven't been catching up with movies listing for nearly 6 weeks, I found it a tough job. Summer really was deprived of attention-grabbing movie titles. My Chinese friends were turned off by the title of this flick itself, The Island. I mean, seriously, who would want to watch a movie called 'The Island', especially when they have no idea what is it all about in the first place? If it wasn't for the brief printed summary at the counter, I would not have given this movie a second glance. Like War of The Worlds, its poster was not self-explanatory. Plus, I did not watch the trailer prior to my trip to the cinema.BUT, unlike War of The Worlds (or any other movies before this), for once I did not question the logic of the flow of the storyline. The storyline was good enough for me to not stop focusing and start being a cynic. At the very least, questions that the average viewer might ask about the plot are answered. It was 100% NOT boring and the plot holes in this movie was subtle because of the relatively fast pace of the story growth. In fact, though I had only watched it once, I don't remember any noticeable loop holes in the storyline. Or questionable action scenes for that matter. I didn't cared if there were futuristic technologies in the movie. After all, the whole thing took place in the future. It was nice that it blended in with the contemporary definitions of the current world, all so that everything seemed viably realistic.Now, there is humor here and there, blended in nicely with action and drama. Noticeable humor genres are satire, sarcasm and banter. The director, Micheal Bay, cleverly played with \"human\" innocence in the movie. The whole innocence thing somehow reminded me of how complex our minds have made today to be. How open the minds of those \"humans\" are to different ideas, compared to many of us in reality. Lincoln Six Echo questioned, and that was what made the difference. That manner reminded me of Dead Poets Society, another good movie.Needless to say, Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson complemented each other well. This is the first time I watched Johansson in action, and I must say, her character development as Jordan Two Delta was good. It was more noticeable than McGregor's part. Lincoln Six Echo was depicted as a skeptic to start with, whereas Jordan Two Delta was very innocent. On the other hand, I was quite surprised that McGregor took up this role as I was quite brainwashed with his role as Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars and Catcher Block in Down With Love. After all, Lincoln Six Echo is more of a character of innocence, curiosity, and mischief, just like a confused child. Nevertheless, it was a refreshing brilliant performance of McGregor.If I were to complain about anything at all, it would be that I didn't manage to buy popcorn because of the long line at the food counter. I don't think people who are just looking for entertainment with depth would complain about this movie.In conclusion, I definitely want to watch this again.</td><td>rw1134661</td><td>This movie is more than an island of questions.</td><td>blackorient</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 2)</td><td>A Walk to Remember (2002)</td><td>10</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>I think this movie is such a beautiful story about two people's love for each other.

Many movies has the same story only with some differences, but not this one. This movie has it's own story. There is so much love and joy that it doesn't take you long before you feel this warmth inside of you. This movie proves that there is so much more to a person than her/his looks.

That is also what happens here, but it was a really stupid move to put some industry people opposing environmentalism as this movie's bad guys.

Although I was definitely a member of the male minority at the preview, this film is not for women only. The film has dogs, drinking with friends, a guy on a date with three women at the same time at the same table. Diane Lane is very convincing in her role as a beautiful divorced woman who is not sure what her next step in life should be. John Cusack's role seems to be one that he has played many times; that of the man in love with the perfect woman who has bad luck.(Serendipity, Hot Pursuit) His character is not as developed as Lane's is. The film lets you get to know Lane's character but Cusack's character leaves a few questions like how does he pay his bills? The supporting cast is wonderful with too many memorable funny scenes to mention them all.

I have had the DVD for a while and watched the film several times before now deciding to write and appreciation of it on IMDb. My conclusion after repeated viewings is that this film is one of THE most romantic films made in the present day. Not crude, vulgar and boring sex scenes, but real love, real passion, complicity, awkwardness of people to show their love but LOVE without the shadow of a doubt !I used to think the film was too slow, with time I now find that this is not the case, of course the haunting theme music and thoughtful filming of coastal scenes made an impression on me from the outset but on my first viewing it did seem to drag a bit and appear overlong. I now change my appreciation of that point. Paul Newman's role is funny and touching and he really is an integral part of the film, Robin Wright was absolutely perfect ( I'm not usually in to tall lanky blondes but make an exception in this case !! ) - her composition was absolutely perfect and Iloved her accent which, for me at least, seem to have just the right tone for a lady in love. As to Kevin Costner, I do wish he could have been a little more aggressively passionate at times to respond to Robin Wright, but this criticism seems to diminish the more I watch it.Nowadays snobbish cinema critics consider a film is not good if it has a happy ending and therefore by definition a good film would need to have a bad ending. Too many people criticise the \"candy coated\" ending to films. Well, why shouldn't they have a happy ending, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that and I consider that kind of film critic to be an inverted snob ! Whatever the ending of \"Message in a Bottle\" ( I will not speak of it here ), this is truly a very good film. If the evolution of my own appreciation is anything to go by I think that with time the film will GROW in importance and stature, just like certain films considered uninteresting at the time of their issue are now considered as veritable masterpieces. This is one of those. Take your time to watch it, stock up with Kleenex (no, it's not a joke) feel the emotion exuded by the players, watch it again and again, you will not come out unscathed emotionally !</td><td>rw1134666</td><td>One of the Ultimate Love Stories - needs repeated viewings !</td><td>nicholas.rhodes</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>Yue man ying lun (1996)</td><td>8</td><td>25 July 2005</td><td>Not many films can keep me watching until almost 2am, but this is one of them.

It concerns the story of Chinese immigrants etching out an existence in London. You'll be wanting to watch it to the end to find out how their lives turn out. I thought that the perspective of a foreign language film, shot entirely in London, was an interesting premise. Usually seeing a foreign language film - this one in Chinese - I'd expect to see it shot in the home country.

The storyline is very predictable, with few surprises. So why did I vote it 7/10? It's a comedy, the writing does rise here and there out of cliché, and the stars - Jones, in particular - have perfect timing. I watched the entire movie, laughed periodically (many's the recent comedy that gets no laughs), and, as one must, didn't take it too seriously. 99% of the pyrotechnics occur in the first ten minutes, and after that it's up to TLJ and the cast to keep it moving and, somehow, they do.

The teenage Mariel Hemingway outshines this bunch. If you're just starting in on Allen films, pick something better like Deconstructing Harry, Shadows and Fog, or Small Time Crooks. Films lovers will laud his cinematic talents but this black and white film just looks murky most of the time.
